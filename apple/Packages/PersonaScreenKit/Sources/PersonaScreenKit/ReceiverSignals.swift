/// What the phone measures of the video stream itself for the quality tiers (#6396), frame by frame: the queueing delay,
/// the rate that arrived, bursts that show the link's headroom, frames arriving late, and whether decoding and showing
/// keep up. The route's own round trip, jitter and loss come from `LinkMeter` (#6398); nothing here repeats them.
///
/// Queueing is a frame's one-way delay (the phone's arrival less the helper's capture time) above the lowest one of the
/// last 10 s, the same rule as the helper's `RateController`, so the two clocks needn't agree. Idle refinement's frames
/// are left out of the queue and the delivered rate (a large frame sent on purpose is no congestion), but their bursts
/// count: they are the cleanest probe of what the link can carry. A keyframe (the helper sends one every 10 s) and the
/// frames that queued behind it while it crossed the link are its wake: left out of `queueP95Ms`, which says whether the
/// link is calm, since that queue is the keyframe's size, not a slower link (#7842); they count everywhere else. Times
/// are µs on the phone's monotonic clock.
///
/// The rate that arrived (`deliveredKbps`) is what the link carried while it was busy: over frames that came in queued
/// behind the one before (both over 50 ms of queueing), their bytes over the time between their arrivals, which is the
/// link's capacity. Only when no frames queued does it fall back to everything that came over the last second, which is
/// then the screen's demand. Averaging in the quiet stretches (the helper skipping, a still screen) would read a busy
/// link as a slow one.
