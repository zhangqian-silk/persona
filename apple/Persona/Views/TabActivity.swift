// reports (docs/apple/ios.md「Foreground-only work」).
//
// The system TabView takes a tab out of the window when another is picked: its onDisappear runs and its tasks are
// cancelled. The shell's two pages (Assistant, Agents) are both kept in the window and only made transparent, so nothing
// stops a hidden page's polling or its read reports. They key off `tabIsActive` as well: they run while the view is in
// the window *and* its page is in front. Under the system TabView this is what happens already (the two change
// together), and a hidden tab that the system briefly puts back in the window no longer restarts its work.
//
// A visible chat's transcript subscription also uses this scope: switching pages must not render a hidden reply or
// mark it read. The Agent still runs on the hub; returning resumes from the retained sequence. Dictation keeps its
// own lifetime; display clocks use `VisibleWork` rather than changing the tab callbacks' voice-call semantics.
