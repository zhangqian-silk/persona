// What each leader conversation's direction is called (docs/assistant/unified-entry.md "Leader conversations"): the
// sidebar's Directions group shows that name, not the conversation's title. `GET /api/v1/assistant` lists only the
// leaders' ids (`assistant.leaders`); the names come from `GET /api/v1/assistant/leaders` (#3519, #3695), which the hub
// works out (the name given, else the project's, else the title without its "MMDD | kind | " prefix).
// Asked again whenever the leaders or their titles change; until it answers, or on a hub that cannot, a row shows its title.
// Names and counts come from the hub's direction tree (GET /api/v1/assistant/directions/tree, #4352): each current
// direction in the leaders' order with its name, its `counts` (Waiting on you is shown, #4331) and whether anything
// under it runs (`running`, the row's activity mark; the working count is not shown, #6626). The tree is
// read and held in one place, lib/direction-tree.ts (the To-dos page and the Agents list draw the same one); this module
// only takes the names and counts from it whenever it changes. The hub sends `directions` whenever the tree changes (a
// leader made or ended anywhere, a name, a task's state), and the page reads the tree again then (readDirectionTree), so
// an open sidebar follows at once. A hub without the tree answers 404: the names come from GET
// /api/v1/assistant/leaders and there are no counts.
