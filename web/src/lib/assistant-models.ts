// What a Persona chat's model pill says (#5033, docs/web/web.md "Model pill and model panel"; docs/assistant/model-config.md
// "A conversation's own model"): the launcher, model and effort its next message runs on, and where that comes from.
// A Persona chat switches models freely: its own pick is kept on the hub (`model_pick`, feature `assistant_model_pick`)
// and holds from the next message on every device; without one the main chat follows Model configuration › Main chat
// and another chat keeps what it started with. On an older hub a pick lasts for this page and goes with each message
// (lib/assistant-chat.ts), as before; the new-conversation page's pick goes with the conversation's start. First-screen
// code: the panel's own data is lib/assistant-panel.ts, loaded with the panel.
