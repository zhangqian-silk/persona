 *   short wait (SETTLE_MS). The hub also drops a turn started by a background task's report (`WokeByTask`) and one
 *   the assistant already pushed about; the web client does not see those and chimes for them.
 * A session with no earlier state (the first snapshot, a new session) produces nothing, so opening the page does not chime.
 * A session "Needs you" only for questions the assistant is still looking at (`interactions`, lookingOnly) counts as
 * working: the hub pushes nothing for them either, and it becomes "Needs you" here once the assistant hands one to the user.
