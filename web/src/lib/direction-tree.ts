// The direction tree (#4352, docs/assistant/unified-entry.md "The direction tree"): each current leader conversation (a
// "direction", shown as 常驻 / Pinned) with the open tasks it supervises, each task with its state and its agents, and
// last the secretary's group (tasks with no leader). The hub builds it once (GET /api/v1/assistant/directions/tree); the
// sidebar, the To-dos page and the Agents page all draw this one tree and never group or rank the tasks themselves.
// This module is the only one that reads and holds it; the Agents list's shape of it is lib/direction-agent-tree.ts
// (kept apart so this module loads light: lib/store.ts reaches it through lib/direction-names.ts).
// Asked on the socket's hello and again on every {"type":"directions"} push (lib/store.ts); a hub without the route
// (404) answers null, and the screens keep what they showed before (no counts, no grouping by direction).
