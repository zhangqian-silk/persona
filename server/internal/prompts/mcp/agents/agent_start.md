Start a new Claude Code agent in the terminal engine (herdr or Orca) of one of the user's computers, in a project directory, with a first prompt. Use for real development work instead of doing it here. Check machines_list for current machine resources and availability before choosing a machine. Returns the new session id. When the launcher failed its last health check on that machine, the agent starts on a machine where it works (a directory under the home moves to that home) and the answer says so. Claude-family launchers always start in bypassPermissions mode; other agent types keep their existing permission behavior.

When the work needs a branch and checkout of its own (work in parallel with what is already open in that repository), give `worktree.branch`: Persona makes the worktree through the machine's engine first (herdr's or Orca's own, so it is listed there and in the app, under the workspace `cwd` is in) and starts the agent in it. Do not tell the agent to run `git worktree add` itself: a worktree made that way is invisible to Orca and to the app. An existing local branch is checked out; a new one starts at the HEAD of the workspace `cwd` is in. A branch already checked out elsewhere is refused.

When the agent needs credentials the user keeps in a secret provider (a token in 1Password, say), give `secret_env`: each environment variable it should have, with the reference its value comes from (such as `op://vault/item/field`), never the secret itself. The user approves the hand-off on a card on iPhone or the web before anything starts, and the values reach only that agent's environment, for this run: you never see them, and the answer lists each variable as granted, declined, expired or failed. Only Claude Code agents on a computer this manager connects take them. Tell the agent the variables are there; never ask it to print them.

Give `ultracode: true` for a large task: one that spans many files or needs checking from several angles (design, tests, review). Claude Code then runs every substantial step as a multi-agent workflow: slower and costlier, so leave it off for small or quick work. Do not write the word "ultracode" into the prompt instead. Claude Code agents only (2.1.284 or later): any other agent, an older Claude Code or a node too old for it starts without it, and the answer says so. Whether it is really on shows as `ultracode=on` in agents_list once Claude Code confirms it. An organization policy may keep some conversations read-only: a call from such a conversation is refused with the policy's reason. Do not retry the same call; follow what the refusal says instead.
