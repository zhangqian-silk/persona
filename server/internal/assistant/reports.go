// Task reports in Feishu (#2768, docs/extensions/bots.md "Task progress"): the user reads the bot's chat, not the app, so how the
// main conversation's tasks go — done, waiting for the user, cut off, did not start, closed by the judge — is told
// there by the bot itself (no lark-cli, nothing to approve per message). Changes within reportDelay are one card:
// what needs the user's decision on top (each with its own answerable card below it), then each task with its stage
// (plan → develop → review → merge → deploy → verified), a line of what happened and links to its page, its PR and its agent.
// That is the card with report_steps on; off (the default) only goal-level changes go out (#3218, below).
// The bot's reports switch turns it off (on by default). With only_conclusions on (#1226) the card carries only how tasks
// ended (closed, did not start): a finished turn, waiting and interrupted stay in the task list and the briefing, and a
// decision waiting still gets its own answerable card. A supervised task's review sends its conclusion card instead (conclusion.go).

// Goal-level reports (#3218): by default the card is not a log of the work. A finished turn, an interruption, a closing
// by the judge and the stage moving on are execution steps and are not pushed; what is pushed is a change of the task's
// goal: reached (the conclusion card, conclusion.go, or the "Please verify" card of deployed work), waiting on the owner
// (the decision's own answerable card) and stuck (it did not start, or its turns were cut off reportStuckAfter times in a
// row). A stuck task's card says the goal, where it is now and one line of evidence with a link: no agent's words, no
// stage bar. The bot's report_steps switch brings back the card as it was.
