// Asks go to the supervisor first (docs/assistant/unified-entry.md "Asks go to the supervisor first"). With leader
// conversations configured (assistant.leaders not empty), a card a supervised task's agent raises — a question, a tool
// approval or a plan — goes to the conversation supervising the task, not to the user: the apps show it marked
// delegating, nothing rings, and the supervisor gets it as a supervision entry. The supervisor answers a question
// itself (interaction_answer; the answer becomes the task's decision), or hands what the user must decide up with
// ask_escalate: every card of the task still waiting then rings the user once, with the supervisor's reason and
// recommendation, and a leader's escalation is an escalated entry in the main conversation, so the layers above know.
// Approvals stay the user's: no conversation can allow a tool or approve a plan (interaction_answer refuses them), so
// they reach the user through ask_escalate or the timeout. A card nobody handles within askHoldFor moves one rung up
// (leader, main conversation, the user; or the background supervisor, then the user, for a task no leader supervises),
// so nothing waits on a supervisor for ever.
//
// The route lives on the pending card, not in the store: after a manager restart the card is back on the apps without
// a push (as every card is), and its route is made again from the task's supervisor (restoreRoute) so that the
// supervisor can still answer or escalate it.

// askHoldFor is how long a card stays with one rung of its ladder before it moves up. The time does not count while
// that rung's conversation is on a turn (askTick): a supervisor working through a long round has not neglected the
// card, and a longer fixed hold would run out under a longer turn all the same.
