// When a "finished" push is worth sending (docs/server/server.md "Push"), and the pushes of the cards. Borrowed from Ovis
// (github.com/devswha/ovis, server/push.ts, MIT): a push is for someone away from the computer, so
//   - wait a while after the turn ends; if the agent resumes, or the user looks at it (herdr idle, or opened in the
//     app), nothing is sent;
//   - only turns that took a while are worth it ("long"); a quick answer is read where it was asked;
//   - background tasks and subagents still running mean the work is not done: hold, and push once when the turn that
//     follows their reports ends.
// The manager decides; the hub delivers (notify.request): each device picks what it wants (its NotifyPrefs), the
// timings are hub.json "notify" (hello's notify).
