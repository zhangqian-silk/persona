// The tests that need Postgres run on a database of their own (dbtest, #583); without PERSONA_TEST_DATABASE_URL they
// skip. Run with a throw-away HOME (testhome): nothing in the package may write the default ~/.persona. Every inbox
// list checks the item bytes GET /api/v1/inbox kept against a fresh encoding (inboxMemoVerify): a change of an item
// that forgets nothing (touched, chainAdd, saveInboxPrepared) fails the run.
//
// Retries that give a real model or hub time to recover wait a millisecond here: the fakes answer a retry as they
// answered the first try, so the real pause (three seconds for the done judge, half a second per phone tool list) only
// added about a minute and a half to the package's run (#7644). The tests of the retries themselves set their own.
