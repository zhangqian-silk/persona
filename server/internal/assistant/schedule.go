// What the assistant does on its own (docs/assistant/assistant.md "Scheduled tasks") is one list of tasks, each with a schedule:
//   - once: a follow-up the assistant scheduled from a conversation (schedule_followup), or the user in the app;
//   - daily: at a time on some weekdays (the morning briefing on weekdays at 09:00…), set up in the app or with schedule_routine;
//   - interval: every N minutes (a 30-minute patrol), from schedule_followup's `every` or the app;
//   - cron: on a 5-field cron expression in the user's time zone ("*/30 9-18 * * 1-5"), from either tool's `cron` or
//     the app (schedule_cron.go). It runs as a daily one does: a time missed by more than 30 minutes is skipped.
// A daily, interval or cron task may set Until. Once that time has passed, the scheduler turns the task off and records a
// skipped run instead of running it. A one-off ignores Until.
// A run goes into the conversation the task came from (SessionID), else into the task's own conversation
// (RunSessionID: the first run starts it, later ones continue it so each run sees the ones before), with the task's
// own launcher, permission mode and effort ("" = the assistant's defaults). A finished run pushes its answer like any agent turn
// (Machine.notifyFinished). The list and the history of runs live in Postgres settings, so they outlive a hub
// restart: a run is marked before it starts (no repeats), a once / interval task missed while the hub was down runs
// once when it is back (and is told how late it is), a daily one missed by more than 30 minutes is skipped and the
// skip shows in the history.
//
// Until 2026-10-31 routines and follow-ups were two lists; a follow-up vanished from the app the moment it started,
// so a patrol re-scheduling itself at the end of each run was nowhere to be seen (or stopped) while a run was stuck
// on an approval. loadSchedule moves the old lists over once, ids and times kept.
