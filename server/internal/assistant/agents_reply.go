// The manager's reminder of an agent still waiting on the user's answer (docs/protocol/agent-states.md "Awaiting your reply", #5096): the
// user looked at an agent that stopped on a question (Session.AwaitsReply) and moved on. Once it has waited
// replyAfter since they looked, one push says it still waits — what it asks, answerable from the notification. Rules
// only: no model is asked and no conversation started, so it costs no tokens and is on unless the user turns it off
// (Settings › Session Triage). A turn is reminded of once; answering it (the agent works again) ends it.
