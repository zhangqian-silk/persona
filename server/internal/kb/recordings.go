// completed later all land on one entry. Only text: the audio stays on the phone, except a meeting transcribed on the
// hub, whose audio the hub keeps until the minutes from its final transcript are written (recording_audio.go). A

// for a meeting with photos photos.json, photos.md and attachments/ (recording_photos.go), for one transcribed on the
// hub hub_segments.json and attachments/audio/ (transcription.go). Uploads journal the accepted files until all
// replacements commit (recording_commit.go). Past recording_days a recording with minutes keeps only meta.json, its
