// Package devicewire is what the hub and the manager that carries the user's computers say to each other over the
// bus about them (docs/protocol/protocol.md "Computers (devices.*)", docs/server/machines.md "Who connects to computers"): the manager (internal/devices, in
// `personad assistant`) connects every computer — the local node, ssh, tailcat, Persona Link in both modes, the ones
// reached through another hub of the mesh — and holds what is known of each; the hub never dials or accepts a
// computer. It hands the manager hub.json's machines as defaults, relays the apps' calls and streams to it, and keeps
// what the manager reports to show the apps. Both sides import this package; neither imports the other.
