// Taking a card's push back once the card is over (#4349): answered on the computer, the web or the watch, withdrawn
// by the agent or expired. A suspended app never gets `interaction_resolved`, so its approval and question pushes
// stayed on the lock screen until it was opened (#3513 is the app's side). The hub sends the devices the card was
// pushed to a silent background push naming the cards that are over, and the app removes their notifications.
//
// iOS gives background pushes a small budget: cards over close together go in one push, a device gets at most one a
// minute, and only devices that said they understand it (`features: ["withdraw"]` at registration) get any.

// featureWithdraw is what a device registers with when it removes the notifications a withdrawal push names.
