// a long-running process that starts others and was handed nothing past stderr on purpose (a manager, a node): a
// descriptor a parent left inheritable, such as an older hub's listening socket, then stays here instead of reaching
// every program this process starts, and through them every program those start (docs/operations/hub-restart.md).
//
// This process keeps using what it holds; only an exec drops it. A descriptor handed to a child on purpose through
// exec.Cmd.ExtraFiles still reaches it: the child gets a copy whatever the flag says. Never call it in a process that
// hands an inherited descriptor on by exec without ExtraFiles (the sandbox's launcher passes its mount data that way).
