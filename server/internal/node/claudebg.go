// Claude sessions that run where Persona has no terminal pane: a background session Claude's own daemon runs (/fork,
// /background: kind "bg"), a session open in Claude's desktop app (entrypoint claude-desktop…), claude in a terminal
// that herdr, Orca, Tern or botmux do not run (entrypoint cli). Each writes sessions/<pid>.json in its config directory with
// the session it has open, its status (busy / idle / shell / waiting) and, since Claude Code 2.1.29x, its peer inbox
// (claudepeer.go). They listed as offline while they worked, and a message from the phone was refused (a second
// claude --resume would write the same transcript, openelsewhere.go). The node lists every live one as running, with
// its status from the file and its transcript as for any session; a message goes through its inbox when the node can
// use it (send) and is refused, with why, when it cannot — never by starting a second claude.
//
// What the phone cannot do there: answer a question or a permission prompt (those are on the computer: no hooks of
// Persona's run in such a claude, and its screen is not Persona's to read), stop a turn (nothing to send Esc to), or
// open a terminal. A claude in a pane of Persona's engines lists there as before (its pane comes first: seen). One
// whose pane variable names a pane no engine in use lists with a claude in it (Orca's terminals on a node without
// Orca, a nested tmux, a claude the engine's process scan missed) lists here as running, after a short grace that
// lets an engine report a claude just started in its pane first (claudeInPane).
//
// An interactive claude that sent its own session to the background keeps that session in its sessions/<pid>.json
// with parkedJobId set, and shows Claude's agents view in its pane until it comes back. herdr still names the pane
// after the session its SessionStart hook reported and reads its state off the terminal title — a background
// session's — so the parked session looked busy with another one's work, and a message to it went into the agents
// view. As in Claude Code (a parked claude does not hold its session), such a pane is not taken for that session.
//
// The agents view opens the job the session went to (Claude's autoOpenJobId), and the pane then is that job's: its
// conversation, its prompt, its name as the terminal title. Such a pane is the background session's (the job's
// sessions/<pid>.json has jobId = the parkedJobId, and its name is the title), so it lists in its herdr tab and takes
// what is typed (2026-11-04: tab 4 of a herdr workspace was missing on the phone, its session listed apart, read-only).
//
// On the agents list (the job ended or stopped, or another one is picked) the pane is still the parked session's tab:
// it lists there, idle (herdr's state is a background session's title), with its terminal: the phone picks a session
// from the list as on the computer (arrows, enter), and the pane is then that one's. A message is not typed into it —
// the list's prompt starts a new background session. Before, such a pane listed nowhere (2026-11-05: tabs 2 and 4
// missing on the phone after their jobs ended).
