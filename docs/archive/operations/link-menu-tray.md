# Archived: Persona Link menu bar and tray before independent services (#6770)

> Naming (#1159): the connection helper is **Persona Link**, and the command is `persona-link`. The installer also puts the old command name beside it as an alias; both names run the same program,
> and its prompts use whichever name you ran. The executable `~/.persona/bin/persona-link`, the download `persona-link-<os>-<arch>.gz`, the systemd unit `persona-link.service`, the launchd identity
> and the helper inside the Mac App carry the new name; what the old names still reach is in [rolling-upgrade-compatibility.md](../protocol/rolling-upgrade-compatibility.md). Copyable commands from the hub and admin page use `persona-link`.

The hub can't reliably SSH into computers such as laptops whose IP and network keep changing. Requested 2026-10-31: no Tailscale or reverse tunnels;
instead, the client on the computer connects to the hub and reconnects on its own after a disconnect, and the hub reuses that link to talk to its node. No SSH or VPN is needed anywhere along the path.

The user decided again on 2026-11-02 ([plan-hub-center.md](../archive/operations/plan-hub-center.md), sections 0 and 4): hubs and computers always connect through a preinstalled service on the computer, not SSH (too much permission);
the computer can connect to the hub or accept a connection from it. The recommendation is one hub for the whole household, with a **node service** on every other computer: resident node plus persona-link, installed by one command or one App.

## On computers: the web app and Persona Link

On a computer, Persona has an Electron desktop app and an independently installable Persona Link ([desktop.md](../desktop/desktop.md)).

- **The desktop app** wraps the hub-hosted web UI and adds native notifications, presence and desktop integration. A computer you only chat from, or use another computer's Agents from, does not need a local node or Link.
- **Persona Link** runs on a computer whose Agents the hub should reach, and does what a browser cannot: it connects the hub to the resident node service and owns the Persona Screen helper. Its CLI/service works without the desktop app, including on Linux and headless computers.
- The local setup window offers fixed status/pairing/reconnect/node-service operations for a separately installed Link. It does not silently install a service. The old Mac menu bar App and Windows tray remain until their pairing, status, service and Persona Screen packaging have a verified replacement.

A desktop need goes into the shared web UI first, and into Persona Link only when the browser cannot meet it (for example local node connectivity, pairing or a recording helper). The desktop app and Link are not a bundled installation.

### Menu bar App or command-line Link

Both run the same persona-link with the `link.json` in their data directory; they differ in how that directory is chosen, what starts persona-link and how you see it.

| | Menu bar App (Mac) | Command-line Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Program | `/Applications/Persona Link.app`, with persona-link and persona-node in `Contents/Helpers/` (`./scripts/app/mac-link.sh install`) | `persona-link`; the installers put it in the data directory's `bin/` (`install.sh --node`, or `persona-link install` on Linux) |
| Data directory | `PERSONA_HOME` in the App's own environment, else the one the node service file names, else the default ("Helper" under "Menu bar App" below) | `PERSONA_HOME` in the environment it starts in, else the default (`~/.persona`, [rename.md](rename.md)) |
| What keeps it running | The App runs `persona-link run --parent` and restarts it when it exits; **Launch at login** starts the App | Linux: the systemd user service `persona-link.service` (`persona-link install`). Mac: nothing from this repository: `persona-link install` refuses on a Mac, and `install.sh --node` installs only the node service and the pairing, leaving `persona-link run` to you |
| State and pairing | Menu bar icon, menu and pairing window | `persona-link status`, `persona-link pair`, `persona-link logs` |
| Where | Mac | Linux (headless or desktop); a Mac without the App |

Windows has one program for both: `persona-link install` sets up the sign-in task and the tray ([windows.md](windows.md)). Linux has no menu bar App, so the command-line Link stays there.

### Move a Mac from the command-line Link to the menu bar App

The App takes over the pairing, the computer's name on the hub and the node service when it opens the data directory the command-line Link used.
The App picks its data directory in this order: `PERSONA_HOME` (or its former name) in its own environment, then the one the node service file names, then the default.
These steps assume the App's own environment sets neither variable, as when it starts from Finder, `open` or as a login item; if yours does, change that first.
One persona-link runs per data directory (the `link.json.run` lock beside `link.json`): while the command-line one runs there, the App's helper exits at once and the App keeps restarting it.
The steps name the command-line program `<link>` and its data directory `<dir>`, as steps 1 and 2 record them. The App's menu, windows and messages follow the system language (English, Simplified Chinese, Japanese); the bold menu names below are the English items.

1. Record how the command-line Link runs:
   - `pgrep -fl 'link run'` prints its process id `<pid>`; the pattern also finds the program under its former name.
   - How it starts: from a terminal, or from something you set up yourself (your own launch agent, a terminal multiplexer). This repository installs nothing that starts it on a Mac.
     Take `<link>`, the program's full path, and any `PERSONA_HOME` (or former name) from that command or setup, not from the `pgrep` output, which drops quoting.
2. Record `<dir>`: in that same environment, `"<link>" status --json` shows `running: true` and `link.pid` equal to `<pid>`; `<dir>` is the directory of its `config` (absolute and normalized).
   Use this `<dir>` from here on, also on the way back. Then check that the App will open it: `"<link>" node status --json` gives the node service file (`file`), and `/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Print :EnvironmentVariables' "<file>"` lists its variables.
   Their `PERSONA_HOME` (or the same variable under its former name, [rolling-upgrade-compatibility.md](../protocol/rolling-upgrade-compatibility.md)) must name `<dir>`, with `~` and relative paths taken from your home folder; with neither, or no node service, `<dir>` must be the default.
   If it names another directory, the node did not share the Link's (the Link reaches the node only through `<dir>/node-attach.sock`): make the node service name `<dir>` before going on. Keep `<dir>` as the base; pairing again does not fix this.
3. Stop the command-line Link: Ctrl-C in its terminal or `kill <pid>`, and stop or remove whatever you set up to start it again.
   `PERSONA_HOME="<dir>" "<link>" status --json` then shows `running: false`. Do not run `persona-link uninstall --purge`: it deletes `link.json`, the pairing the App takes over.
4. Install the App: `./scripts/app/mac-link.sh install`. It builds, copies the App to `/Applications/Persona Link.app` and opens it.
   Use only "Prerequisites" and "Build and install" in [persona-link-install.md](persona-link-install.md); skip its "Pairing".
5. Do not pair again: the App opens `<dir>` and connects with the pairing there. If its menu says the Mac is not connected to a hub yet, it opened another directory: quit it and go back to step 2.
6. Leave the node service as it is. On first launch the App checks for a node service and installs one only when there is none. An existing one, under the current or the former name, stays unchanged.
7. Check the result:
   - The menu says the local node is online (**Local node online**) and names this computer on the hub.
   - `pgrep -fl 'link run'` lists only `…/Persona Link.app/Contents/Helpers/persona-link run --parent`.
   - `PERSONA_HOME="<dir>" "/Applications/Persona Link.app/Contents/Helpers/persona-link" status --json` shows the same `config` as step 2, `running: true`, `link.state` `connected`,
     and a `link.pid` equal to the helper's process id from `pgrep`. Another `link.pid` means another persona-link still holds the lock: go back to step 3.
   - The computer is online in the web app's **Machines**.
8. Turn on **Launch at login** in the menu.

**Optional, later: the device's program.** The App works with the node service on either program. When `node status --json` shows it runs personad (`runs`) and this Mac runs no hub or manager,
`PERSONA_HOME="<dir>" "/Applications/Persona Link.app/Contents/Helpers/persona-link" node switch`, in Terminal on the Mac, moves it to persona-node.
The switch restarts the node and cuts off an answer the assistant is writing on this computer; conditions and recovery are in "The device's program" below.

**To go back**:

1. In the App's menu, turn off **Launch at login** and choose **Quit Persona Link**; its helper exits with it. `PERSONA_HOME="<dir>" "<link>" status --json` shows `running: false`.
2. Start the command-line Link the way step 1 recorded, and put back anything you removed in step 3; from a terminal, `PERSONA_HOME="<dir>" "<link>" run`.
   `PERSONA_HOME="<dir>" "<link>" status --json` shows `running: true` and the same `config` as step 2.
3. To remove the App, delete only `/Applications/Persona Link.app`. Keep `<dir>` (pairing, passive-mode TLS identity, logs), the node service and its program, and the computer on the hub.
   Do not follow "Uninstall" in [persona-link-install.md](persona-link-install.md): it removes those shared files and the computer on the hub.

## Two modes

The same persona-link supports both, selected during pairing and changeable anytime (`persona-link mode active|passive`, or the pairing window of the Mac menu bar App or the Windows tray). Each mode stores its pairing separately, so switching back doesn't require pairing again.

| Mode | Who connects to whom | Best for | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Active** (connect to the hub) | persona-link dials the hub's WSS `/api/v1/link` ("Link" below) | Laptops, computers behind NAT or frequently changing networks | The hub has a TLS port (`public.tls_listen`) or sits behind an HTTPS reverse proxy ("[Hub behind a reverse proxy](#hub-behind-a-reverse-proxy)" below); this computer can reach the hub directly or through an SSH tunnel ("[SSH tunnel](#ssh-tunnel)" below) |
| **Passive** (let the hub connect) | The hub dials the TLS port persona-link listens on locally ("Passive mode" below) | Computers with stable addresses reachable by the hub: servers, development workstations, home desktops | The hub can reach this computer's port (directly or through a SOCKS proxy); the computer's firewall opens this port only to the hub |

Choosing: the computer can reach the hub but the hub can't reach it (a laptop, a computer on a company intranet connecting to a home hub) → active; the hub can reach it but it can't reach the hub (the hub is somewhere unreachable from the public internet,
but can enter the computer's network through a proxy), or you don't want the computer initiating outbound connections → passive. If both directions work, either is fine; active needs no open port and is simpler.

## Install the node service

Where to get a pairing link: preferably from **Machines › Add Computer** on the signed-in web app (iOS and Android entry points are in progress). It provides a full copyable command or link for the selected OS;
after the computer connects, confirm **This is my computer** on the same screen ("[Connecting a computer](#connecting-a-computer-mac-example)" below). The admin interface and command-line steps on the hub machine are in that section's "Advanced" subsection.

**Linux** (one command, the "node" role in `scripts/deploy/install.sh`):

```sh
curl -fsSL <site>/install.sh | sh -s -- --node --pair '<pairing link>'   # Active
curl -fsSL <site>/install.sh | sh -s -- --node --listen [:18663] [--addr <address the hub uses to reach this computer>]         # Passive
```

- Downloads persona-node, the device's own program ("[The device's program](#the-devices-program)"), and persona-link (both verified against `SHA256SUMS`) to `~/.persona/bin/`, then hands off to `persona-link install`: installs the resident node's systemd user service
  `personad-node` (running persona-node; one that is there already is left as it is, then switched with `persona-link node switch`) and persona-link's own service, pairs, and waits for connection (passive mode: waits for the listener to start, then prints a link for the hub admin interface).
  A release without persona-node, or a computer that runs a hub or a manager, gets personad instead, as before.
- `--pair` / `--listen` imply `--node`; so do `PERSONA_ROLE=node`, `PERSONA_PAIR`, `PERSONA_LISTEN`. With no options and a terminal, it asks;
  if a hub is already detected on the LAN (mDNS `_persona-hub._tcp`, `persona-link discover`), it first says "One hub is enough for the whole household; install the node service on this computer."
- Without systemd, it still installs the binaries and prints alternative instructions (see "Linux (headless)").
- On Mac, `--node` only installs the resident node's launchd agent and pairs; the menu bar App handles the connection.
- Publishing: `scripts/publish.sh` builds four extra `persona-link-<os>-<arch>.gz` and `persona-node-<os>-<arch>.gz` files alongside personad and adds them to the same `SHA256SUMS`.

**Mac**: install the **Persona Link** menu bar App (`./scripts/app/mac-link.sh install`; a step-by-step guide for others is in [persona-link-install.md](persona-link-install.md)). The App includes persona-node (`Contents/Helpers/persona-node`), and **on first launch** runs
`persona-link node install --node-bin <inside the App>` to install the resident node LaunchAgent `com.persona.node`: when there is no agent yet, it copies persona-node to `~/.persona/bin/persona-node` (unless one is there) and the new agent runs it (on a Mac that runs a hub or a manager, their personad);
an existing agent is left unchanged (for example one from `scripts/deploy/node-launchd.sh install`), and one that runs personad moves over with `persona-link node switch`. Afterwards it only offers **Install local node service** in the menu; a service the user deletes isn't reinstalled automatically.
The agent it writes has `ProcessType=Interactive` (the same as `node-launchd.sh`), so launchd doesn't throttle the node like a background job. Since an existing installation is left unchanged, one written before #5944 lacks it: `personad node doctor` reports it and `personad node doctor --fix` adds it (docs/server/server.md "Scheduling and privacy on the Mac").
App updates don't replace the installed resident node. Nodes supporting the update protocol can be remotely updated by the hub over the existing connection, with backup, rollback and online confirmation; first-time local upgrades for old nodes, progress and installation boundaries are in [node-update.md](node-update.md) (#1158).

**Windows** (Orca engine, [windows.md](windows.md) ("Install and start at logon")): `persona-link install --personad <personad.exe> [--pair '<link>']`, without admin privileges.
Registers the current user's scheduled task **Persona Link**, starting at sign-in and checked every 5 minutes; it runs a windowless supervisor (`persona-link supervise`), which starts
persona-link and the resident node and restarts them on exit. Both are in one task (no separate `node install`). It also installs and starts the tray icon ([windows.md](windows.md), "Tray"; `--no-tray` skips it). There is no one-command installer script or installation package (#1179).

### The device's program

A device runs persona-node (`server/cmd/persona-node`), the node and the commands its Agents run (hook, MCP, ask, notify, launch, …) without the hub or the manager, at `~/.persona/bin/persona-node`. A hub or a manager runs personad at `~/.persona/bin/personad`. The two are separate files, so a computer that has both keeps both.

- **New node services run persona-node** where the computer has it: `persona-link node install` (and `persona-link install`, the Mac App) picks `bin/persona-node`, else `bin/personad`. On a computer that runs a hub or a manager (its data directory has `hub.json` or `managers/*/manager.json`) the node stays on personad: their services run personad too, and it updates with the node.
- **Existing node services keep running personad** until they are switched. `persona-link node switch` (run by `install.sh --node`) does it whole or not at all, holding a lock (`~/.persona/node-switch.lock`) the whole time:
  1. It keeps the service file as it is (`~/.persona/node-switch.backup`, written and synced to disk first).
  2. It points the service at `bin/persona-node`. Only the program changes; the file's other settings stay. When the computer has no persona-node yet but persona-link came with one (the Mac app's `Contents/Helpers/persona-node`), that one is put in place first.
  3. It restarts the service (systemd `daemon-reload` and `restart`; launchd `bootout` and `bootstrap`, the latter tried again for a few seconds). On a Mac it runs only in the desktop's session (`launchctl managername` is `Aqua`, as in Terminal on the Mac); over ssh it is refused before anything changes, and so is undoing an unfinished switch, because launchd there may take the agent away and then refuse to load one again. The node stays on the program it runs.
  4. It waits up to 60 s for the node to answer `ping` on `node.sock` as persona-node, then drops the backup.

  When persona-node does not answer, or the switch is stopped (Ctrl-C, TERM, the terminal closing), the old file comes back, the service restarts on personad, and the command says why. The backup goes only once the service manager has taken the restart (or a node answers all the same): when launchd refuses the old agent's `bootstrap` for longer than the retries, it stays, and the next recovery starts it again. A switch cut off harder (`kill -9`, the computer losing power) leaves the backup: `persona-link node status` says so, and the running `persona-link run` (it looks every 30 s and when it starts, and writes what it did to `link.log`) or the next `persona-link node install`/`switch` puts it back; `persona-link node uninstall` drops it with the service. None of that touches a switch that holds the lock (`node install`, `persona-link install`'s node step and `node uninstall` refuse while one runs), and a backup that is no usable service file (empty, or naming a program that is not there) is dropped rather than put back. `bin/personad` is never touched.
  The switch restarts the node at once: an answer the assistant is writing on that computer at that moment is cut off (Agents in herdr go on).
- **Back to personad**: `persona-link node switch --to personad` does the same the other way. `install.sh --hub` and the manager's install script run it when the node service file names `persona-node` (whoever wrote it, the Mac app included), because a computer that runs a hub or a manager keeps its node on personad, which updates with the node. `personad hub setup` and `personad manager install` run directly do not: run the switch yourself there. A manager joined into a directory outside `~/.persona/managers/` is not seen as one.
- The node writes the hook and MCP configs of the sessions it starts with its own path at every connection, so after a switch they run persona-node, and after a rollback personad again.
- `node.info` says which program runs the node and from which file (`program`, `executable`, [protocol.md](../protocol/protocol.md) "Node handshake"); Redeploy sends the device's file persona-node of the build it should run (the hub's own, or the release's, [node-update.md](node-update.md) "Node packages"), else personad to that same file, which persona-node replaces again later. `node-update-check` prints `program` too, which is how scripts tell the two apart. `persona-link node install --node-bin <persona-node>` (and `persona-link install --node-bin`) puts the device's program in beside a personad the computer may have (unless it runs a hub or a manager, where it is refused).
- The office skill the node gives its sessions runs `office` with whichever program is there (personad, else persona-node).
- Windows has no persona-node build yet: its node runs personad.

**On the hub side**: active-mode computers are kind `link` in hub.json; passive-mode ones are kind `service` (the hub side implemented in #435; paste the link in admin **Computers › Add Computer › Hub connects**).

## Responsibilities

- **persona-link** (`server/cmd/persona-link`, also reachable as `server/cmd/persona-link`; `server/internal/link`): a separate small program doing only these things:
  - Discovery: find the hub among candidate addresses and connect;
  - Reporting: identify the computer, version and address used;
  - Link: maintain the connection and forward streams opened by the hub unchanged to the local resident node;
  - Summary: put the hub's "Needs you" summary into its status for the menu bar App and the tray (see "Needs you").

  It implements no specific feature.
- **node is unchanged**: all features live in `personad node`. This computer needs a resident node (installed together under "Install the node service" above; separately, use `persona-link node install`
  or `scripts/deploy/node-launchd.sh install`); persona-link forwards streams only to its socket `~/.persona/node-attach.sock`. This is the same path that SSH-started `node --stdio` forwarded to
  (`internal/node/attach.go`). Writing a systemd / launchd service for the resident node is packaging, not functionality: the service contents match those written by `scripts/deploy/node-launchd.sh`.
  Because the resident node runs in the user's login session, features that need that session live there too, such as
  sharing the computer's clipboard with the phone ([clipboard.md](clipboard.md)).
- **hub and manager** (since 2026-11-04 computers belong to the manager, [machines.md](../server/machines.md), "Who connects to computers"):
  - This computer is kind `link` in hub.json; nobody SSHs into it;
  - Persona Link still connects to the hub address; after authenticating, the hub forwards the connection unchanged to the manager (`devices.accept` + `GET /api/v1/bus/relay`, preserving individual messages and close codes);
    the manager speaks the protocol below;
  - As soon as the link says hello, the manager opens a stream to connect to the node (streams Persona Link opens are also relayed through the hub); the node protocol on the stream is exactly the SSH protocol;
  - When the link disconnects, this computer goes offline immediately; while the manager is away the hub returns 503 on `/api/v1/link`, and Persona Link backs off normally and connects when the manager returns.
- **Mac** uses the **Persona Link** menu bar App (`apple/PersonaLink/`), with persona-link packaged as a helper and started and supervised by the App.
  On **Linux** (servers, NAS, Raspberry Pi, no GUI), `persona-link install` installs itself as a systemd user service; see "Linux (headless)";
  on **Windows**, it installs as a sign-in scheduled task supervising both it and the resident node, plus a tray icon that does what the Mac App's menu does; see [windows.md](windows.md), "Install and start at logon" and "Tray".

## Link (active mode)

```text
persona-link ── WSS /api/v1/link ──▶ hub TLS port (public.tls_listen)
  → hello {machine, version, address, features?}
                                               First message; hub closes with 4003 if machine id doesn't match credentials;
                                               features: ["attention"] asks for the "Needs you" summary
  ← endpoints {endpoints, hub_name, mesh_hubs, ping_ms?, ping_timeout_ms?, pending?, machine_name?}
                                               Sent on connect and again when hub addresses, linked group, heartbeat, pending status or this computer's name changes
  ← open {id}                                  hub wants to connect to node
      persona-link connects ~/.persona/node-attach.sock first, then opens WSS /api/v1/link/stream?id=<id>, forwarding bytes unchanged both ways
  → open_failed {id, error}                    Can't open (resident node not running, etc.); hub records the reason as this computer's error
  ← node {online, error}                       Whether hub connected to node, displayed in the menu bar
  → rename {id, machine_name}                  Asks the hub to call this computer machine_name ("": its id again); see "The computer's name"
  ← renamed {id, machine_name | code, error}   The hub's answer to that rename: the name it has now, or why not
  ← attention {attention}                      The "Needs you" summary, to a link whose hello asked for it: right after endpoints, then on every change
```

Both sides ignore a message type they don't know.

**Route selection**
- Candidate addresses are ordered "LAN → public IPv6 → domain → public IPv4", with manually added addresses first within their category.
- Starts trying the next candidate every 300 ms, several concurrently; the first connection wins and late successes are closed. Each candidate has an 8-second timeout.
- Away from home, even if LAN addresses fail or hang, it waits only another 300 ms before trying the next. These are configured values, not measured results.
- With an optional SSH tunnel (`ssh` in `link.json`, see "[SSH tunnel](#ssh-tunnel)" below): **Always use SSH** dials only the tunnel; otherwise direct candidates are raced first and the tunnel is used if all fail (and tried first on the next reconnect when the tunnel was the last working route, while probing direct candidates every 2 minutes to switch back).

**Hub name and linked group**
- The hub includes `hub_name` in `endpoints`: `name` from hub.json, otherwise the short hostname of the hub machine; in Docker (where the hostname is a container id), `hub-<first 6 characters of hub_id>`
  ([config.md](config.md)); and `mesh_hubs`: the number of hubs in its linked group, including itself. Before linked hubs (#294) landed, this was fixed at 1, returned by `meshHubCount()`
  and wired up by the mesh lane; when the group changes the hub sends `endpoints` again (`sendLinkEndpoints`).
- persona-link saves the name as `hub_name` in link.json, so it knows which hub even when disconnected; status includes `hub_name`, and `mesh_hubs` while connected.
- The name is restricted to one printable line (control characters become spaces), up to 80 characters.
- Old hubs send neither: neither field appears in status, the Mac menu stays as before, and `persona-link status` displays the hub id. An `endpoints` message containing a name but no addresses does not clear candidate addresses.

**Pending confirmation** (#4655)
- A computer added through **Add Computer** on the phone / web is pending until the user taps **This is my computer** (`hub/machine_trust.go`). The hub hands pending machine ids to the manager (`pending` in `devices.config`),
  and the manager's `endpoints` to that computer's link carries `pending: true`; once confirmed (or rejected or expired), the hub hands over the config again and the manager sends `endpoints` without `pending`.
- `endpoints` is per machine: every message describes that computer's current state; absent `pending` means confirmed. persona-link updates `pending` in its status line accordingly.
- Old hubs don't send it: status omits `pending` and shows confirmed (Persona Link's status page already handles this in #4198). Passive mode (hub connects to computer) doesn't have it yet.

**The computer's name**
- The hub calls each computer by its hub.json `name` (its id when it has none). The id never changes: pins, mutes, trust and credentials are all by id; only the name is shown.
- Hubs that rename computers (hello feature `machine_rename`) say the name in `endpoints` (`machine_name`) and send `endpoints` again when it changes. persona-link keeps it as `machine_name` in link.json,
  shows it in its status (`machine_name`), in `persona-link status` (with the id in parentheses when they differ) and in the tray / menu bar. Old hubs say nothing: everything shows the id as before.
- It can be renamed from either end, and every side follows without a restart or reconnect:
  - On the computer: `persona-link name <new>` (`--reset`: back to the id; no argument: shows it), the Windows tray's **Rename this computer…**. They ask the running persona-link, which sends `rename` on its link;
    the manager asks the hub (`devices.rename`), the hub writes hub.json and answers, and persona-link reports the answer (`rename` in its status, by the request's id). The request is a file beside link.json
    (`link.rename.json`), taken within half a second; one older than 30 seconds is dropped.
  - On the hub: the admin page (`PUT /api/v1/admin/machines/{id}`) or a signed-in device (`PUT /api/v1/machines/{id}/name`); see [protocol.md](../protocol/protocol.md) "Computers".
- Only a confirmed computer renames itself: one waiting for the user to confirm it (`pending`) is refused (`pending`), so it can't pass itself off as another computer by name. Passive mode has no link to ask on:
  rename it on the hub; the hub's info reads carry the name (`X-Persona-Machine-Name`, URL-escaped) and the connector keeps it in link.json's `passive.machine_name`.
- Pairing hands the hub what this computer's system calls it (`system_name` with the pairing request: the Mac's Computer Name, else the host name). The hub names a computer after it once, when the computer has
  no name of its own yet (added without one, so its name is its id); a name it was given, or one the user set later, is kept. Nothing renames the computer itself.
- Names are one line, at most 40 characters (the hub refuses longer ones with `invalid_name`).

**TLS**
- Pins the hub public-key fingerprint received during pairing (SHA-256 of SubjectPublicKeyInfo); LAN connections also use TLS.
- The hub certificate is self-signed; trust comes from this fingerprint, just like the App's public direct connection ([network.md](network.md), "TLS and public-key pinning").
- If the pairing link has no fingerprint (the hub doesn't serve TLS itself and sits behind an HTTPS reverse proxy), validate the proxy certificate against system-trusted CAs and the hostname; see "[Hub behind a reverse proxy](#hub-behind-a-reverse-proxy)".
  Pairings with a fingerprint accept only the pinned public key and never fall back to system CAs.

**Reporting**
- The first message after connecting is hello, reporting this computer's machine id, persona-link version and chosen address.
- The manager checks that the machine id matches the computer bound to the credentials (the hub includes that binding when forwarding), then immediately opens a stream to the node without waiting for the SSH retry interval.
- This computer gets an extra `link` field in the machine list: `{version, address, since}`.

**Heartbeat**
- Both sides ping every 10 seconds and disconnect after 5 seconds without pong. Dead links are detected in about 15 seconds.
- Slow links can be configured in hub.json's `link` (`ping_seconds`, `ping_timeout_seconds`, [config.md](config.md)): the hub pings accordingly, and when configured the manager includes
  `ping_ms`, `ping_timeout_ms` in `endpoints`; Persona Link adopts them without reconnecting. If absent (old hub, unconfigured) or not both positive, it uses its own values. New connections use their own values until the hub speaks.
  Both sides clamp them between 50 milliseconds and 10 minutes (`link.PingTimes`). Older Persona Link versions don't recognize these fields and retain 10 seconds / 5 seconds.
- Ping queues behind data already being sent on the connection: at only tens of KB per second from hub to computer, a 1 MiB block takes over 30 seconds; any shorter timeout guarantees disconnects, repeating after reconnect.
- Two deadlines heartbeat tuning doesn't control (`docs/lessons/server.md`, "Heartbeat timeouts on slow links"): coder/websocket waits at most 5 seconds for the write lock when sending ping / pong, so it still disconnects while a message larger than the send buffer is being written;
  the hub relay waits at most 1 minute to write one message (`spliceWS`), so a 1 MiB block still times out below roughly 17 KB/s. The hub's link-stop reason includes the ping error to distinguish these cases.
- The hub also pings streams, detecting when the link is alive but a stream's TCP connection silently died.
- Ping runs between hub and Persona Link (the hub owns this end of the connection): without pong, the hub closes it, and the relay to the manager closes with "no pong within …"; the manager treats that as a disconnected link.
  The hub reports each pong round-trip to the manager (`devices.link_rtt`), which supplies the path distance for routing and records sent to the primary hub.
- These are configured values, not measured results.

**Reconnect**
- Exponential backoff: starts at 1 second, doubles up to 1 minute; randomized between half and full delay each time. After a link connected for a full minute disconnects, it starts over.
- Special cases:

  | Case | Wait |
  | --- | --- |
  | Replaced by a new link from the same computer (4001) | 30 seconds |
  | Credentials rejected (401 / 403) or revoked (4002) | 5 minutes, or retry within 2 seconds when link.json changes (re-pairing) |
  | Hub restarts (1001) | Normal backoff |
  | Manual **Reconnect now** | No wait |
  | Paired again or SSH tunnel edited while connected (new token, pin, trust, machine or `ssh` in link.json) | No wait: the link ends as with **Reconnect now** and comes back with the new configuration within about 2 seconds |

- Any wait ends within 2 seconds when link.json changes (re-paired, an address added). The change counts from when the attempt read link.json, so a new credential written while the hub was refusing the old one is tried at the next check, not after 5 minutes; while a link is up, only a new credential counts (the link writes the hub's addresses and names into link.json itself).
- While connected, persona-link looks at link.json every 2 seconds when its modification time changed and compares the pairing itself (token, pin, trust, machine), not just the time: the hub's endpoints and renames rewrite link.json with the same pairing and leave the link alone.
- Only one persona-link can run per computer (`~/.persona/link.json.run` file lock), or they replace each other repeatedly.

**Network changes**
- Mac: the App uses `NWPathMonitor` and sends helper `SIGUSR1` on a network change:
  - If the link's original local address is gone, reconnect immediately;
  - If still present, ping immediately (3 seconds, or the hub-configured heartbeat timeout if longer), reconnecting on failure;
  - If already disconnected, retry immediately.
- Linux: persona-link watches address changes itself with netlink (`internal/netaddr`); Windows: with `NotifyIpInterfaceChange` (same package).
- **Reconnect now** is `SIGUSR2`. Windows has no such signals: there the two are named events the tray sets ([windows.md](windows.md), "Tray"). Waiting for pong blocks neither this nor the network-change check: on a slow link, ping may wait the hub's entire configured timeout.

**Forwarding**
- Only forwards to `~/.persona/node-attach.sock` and only connects back to the hub address used by this link; stream ids may contain only letters, digits, `-`, `_`. The hub can't make it connect elsewhere.
- Streams enable permessage-deflate compression without context takeover (`link.StreamCompression`): each message is compressed on its own, so an idle stream keeps no compression state (with context takeover, about 0.8 MB per end, for about a sixth fewer bytes on the wire). Either end asking for it is enough, so it also applies when only the hub or only Persona Link is new. SSH previously used `Compression=yes`; see the comment in `devices/machine.go` (the hub-to-manager hop is local loopback and isn't compressed).
- To the resident node, each stream is a new attach connection, replacing the previous one just as with SSH.

## Hub behind a reverse proxy

When the hub doesn't serve TLS itself and is mounted under a reverse proxy's subpath (`public_url` is `https://<domain>/<prefix>`, the proxy has a public-CA certificate and strips the prefix before forwarding to the hub's plaintext port),
the phone App and web already work ([network.md](network.md), "Reverse-proxy subpaths (Android)"), and active-mode Persona Link works too (#2573):

```text
persona-link ── WSS https://<domain>/<prefix>/api/v1/link ──▶ reverse proxy (TLS, public CA) ── strip /<prefix>, plaintext ──▶ hub listen port
```

- **Pairing**: without hub TLS, `personad hub pair --machine <id>` (and **Pairing link** in admin) still returns a link if `public_url` is `https://…`: its `url` is `public_url`,
  with no `fp` or `tls`. persona-link accepts this link, preserving the path prefix and spelling out the port (`https://<domain>:443/<prefix>`, matching candidates sent by the hub);
  link.json stores `"trust": "system"` and no fingerprint. A link with no `fp` and no `https://` `url` is rejected (no usable address).
- **Validation**: every candidate in this pairing is checked against system-trusted CAs and the hostname (TLS 1.2 or later, `http/1.1`), like opening the web app in a browser. Pairings with `fp` still accept only the pinned public key:
  if the proxy certificate doesn't match, the error is "TLS public-key fingerprint differs from pairing", with no fallback to system CAs.
- **Link**: `/api/v1/link`, `/api/v1/link/stream` and pairing's `/api/v1/auth/tokens` are appended after the prefix; heartbeat, reconnect backoff and routing remain as above. The hub's candidates already include the prefix in `public_url`.
- **Hub side**: requests arriving through the proxy are plaintext; the hub accepts links only in these two cases (credentials must still match):
  - Proxy and hub are on the same machine (loopback source);
  - Proxy is on another LAN machine (private source address), and forwarding headers say it received HTTPS: `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` (or `Forwarded: proto=https`).

  Plaintext from public sources is always rejected (`403 tls_required`), whatever the headers; other entry points (App APIs, bus, mesh) are unaffected. If the hub runs in Docker and port mapping makes the source appear as a container gateway, it is treated as public;
  add the gateway to `security.trusted_cidrs` ([network.md](network.md), "Source classification and reverse proxies"). Forwarding headers can be spoofed: on the LAN, spoofing only lets one's own link credentials travel in plaintext; Persona Link itself never sends plaintext.
- **Status**: `persona-link status` adds "Validation: via reverse proxy · system certificates"; `trust` in `--json` is `system` (`pin` for pinning); the running status line carries `"trust": "system"`;
  the menu bar App shows "Via reverse proxy · system certificates" below the connection method, and the pairing window explains it above the address list. Untrusted certificates and hostname mismatches report "Certificate not trusted by the system" and "Certificate hostname doesn't match" respectively.

nginx example (replace placeholders; put `map` in `http { }`, and `location` in the port-443 `server { }`):

```nginx
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
    default upgrade;
    ''      close;
}

location /<prefix>/ {
    proxy_pass http://<hub address>:<hub listen port>/;   # Trailing / strips the prefix
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;              # WebSocket: /api/v1/ws, /api/v1/link, /api/v1/link/stream
    proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;            # Allows a plaintext link when proxy is on another LAN machine
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_buffering off;
    proxy_read_timeout 1h;                               # Long connection: exceed heartbeat (default 10s, configurable in hub.json link) with margin
    proxy_send_timeout 1h;
}
```

**Trade-off**: pinning trusts one hub public key; system trust trusts every CA in the system. Any CA that signs for this domain (a compromised or mistaken CA, or device management able to install roots on this computer) can impersonate the hub,
obtain this computer's link credentials and connect hub streams to its resident node. This is the same as accessing the web app in a browser: better than plaintext, weaker than pinning. The proxy-to-hub hop is plaintext and must be on a trusted network (same machine or LAN).
Prefer the hub's own TLS and fingerprint when possible; when hub TLS is enabled, pairing links always carry `fp` and won't use system trust.

## SSH tunnel

When a hub machine exposes only SSH (port 22) — its HTTP and TLS ports listen on `127.0.0.1` only, with no open public port or reverse proxy — active-mode Persona Link can reach the hub's TLS port through an SSH tunnel (#3775), matching the apps' SSH tunnel ([network.md](network.md), "Connecting to hub through SSH").

> **How this fits the "No SSH" decision at the top of this page.** "No SSH" there is about the hub SSH-ing into computers, which requires inbound reachability and gives the hub shell-level permission on the computer. Here the computer still dials out as before; SSH is only an optional transport to reach the hub's TLS port, and the hub gains no access to the computer.

### Setting up an SSH-only hub

1. Keep the hub's HTTP and TLS listeners on loopback in `hub.json` (for example `listen` `127.0.0.1:18660`, `public.tls_listen` `127.0.0.1:18662`).
2. Generate the pairing link on the hub machine:
   ```sh
   personad hub pair --machine <id> --add --name "<display name>"
   ```
   The resulting `persona://link?…` carries `url=http://127.0.0.1:18660`, `tls=18662` and `fp=<hub fingerprint>`.
3. Optionally dedicate an SSH key to Persona Link and restrict it in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the SSH server so it can forward only to the hub's loopback TLS port and cannot open a shell:
   ```text
   restrict,port-forwarding,permitopen="127.0.0.1:18662" ssh-ed25519 AAAA... persona-link
   ```
   Replace `18662` with the hub's TLS port (`public.tls_listen`).

### Pairing window and CLI

- **Pairing window (Mac menu bar App and Windows tray)**: under **Connect to hub** (active mode), an **SSH tunnel** disclosure section sits below the pairing link. It stays closed by default until opened or until a tunnel is saved, and can be filled in **before** pairing so the pairing request itself travels through the tunnel:
  - **SSH server**: `[user@]host[:port]`, or a host alias from `~/.ssh/config`.
  - **Hub address as that server sees it**: defaults to `127.0.0.1:<TLS port in the pairing link>`; with no link and no saved address yet, to `127.0.0.1:18662`, the TLS port `personad hub setup` uses.
  - **Always use SSH**: uses only the tunnel. Enabled automatically when the pairing link names only loopback addresses; otherwise off so direct addresses are tried first.
  - **Test connection**: opens a one-off tunnel, verifies TLS against the hub, and shows the result in plain words.
  - After pairing, the same section edits, switches **Always use SSH**, or removes the tunnel (**Remove tunnel**) without pairing again; the running link reconnects within about 2 seconds.
- **Command line** (Linux, scripts, or the helper called by the GUI windows):
  ```sh
  persona-link pair --ssh user@example.com [--ssh-target 127.0.0.1:18662] [--ssh-always | --no-ssh-always] '<link>'
  persona-link ssh                                      # Show saved tunnel
  persona-link ssh user@example.com [--target host:port] [--always | --no-always]
  persona-link ssh --test [--link '<link>']             # Test tunnel end to end
  persona-link ssh --off                                # Remove tunnel without unpairing
  ```
  `persona-link install --pair '<link>' --ssh user@example.com …` accepts the same `--ssh*` flags during installation.
- **`link.json`**: stored alongside `endpoints` as `"ssh": {"server": "user@example.com", "target": "127.0.0.1:18662", "always": true}` (`always` omitted when false).

### Transport, TLS, routing and errors

- **System `ssh` client**: `persona-link` runs the system `ssh` binary (`-N -L 127.0.0.1:<ephemeral>:<target> -o BatchMode=yes -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes`, plus `-p <port>` when specified). It uses the keys, `ssh-agent`, `ProxyJump` and `known_hosts` the user already configured, stores no SSH key or password, and never prompts interactively.
- **One SSH session for the link and all streams**: the active link WebSocket (`/api/v1/link`) and every Agent stream (`/api/v1/link/stream`) dial through the same local forward on that single `ssh` process, so opening Agent sessions triggers no extra SSH authentication or hardware-key touch. Killing `ssh` or losing the network drops the link and reconnects automatically; quitting, switching to passive mode, switching back to a direct route, or unpairing terminates the `ssh` process cleanly.
- **End-to-end TLS unchanged**: the TLS handshake (pinned to `fp`, or checked against system CAs and hostname when `trust` is `system`) still runs end to end through the tunnel to the hub's TLS port; a wrong hub key is refused identically to a direct connection. Over the tunnel, `hello.address` is left empty so the hub does not record the SSH server string as one of its own HTTPS URLs.
- **Routing order**:
  - **Always use SSH** on: only the tunnel is dialed; direct hub candidates are skipped.
  - **Always use SSH** off: direct candidates are raced first, and the tunnel is dialed when all of them fail. When the last working connection used the tunnel, the next reconnect dials the tunnel immediately instead of waiting for direct candidates to fail again, while probing direct candidates every 2 minutes (`link.DirectRetryEvery`) and on network changes to switch back and close the tunnel once a direct address answers.
- **Status and plain-word errors**: when connected through the tunnel, status reports `"kind": "ssh"` and `"address": "<server>"`, labelled **SSH** in `en`, `zh-Hans` and `ja` across `persona-link status`, the Mac menu bar App and the Windows tray (and marked **In use** in the address list). Five failure modes each produce a distinct single-sentence explanation (`ssh_error` in the status line): no `ssh` command installed, authentication refused, server host key not trusted yet (with `ssh [-p <port>] <server>` to accept it once in a terminal), port forwarding refused by the server (`AllowTcpForwarding` / `permitopen`), and the hub not answering at `<target>`.

## Passive mode (the hub connects)

The protocol is fixed in [plan-hub-center.md](../archive/operations/plan-hub-center.md), section 4; details are here. The dialing side (#435) follows this specification and has belonged to the manager since 2026-11-04
(`server/internal/devices/service.go`; credentials generated during pairing are handed to the hub for encrypted storage with its key and retrieved when dialing). Implementation: `server/internal/link/`
(`listen.go` for the listener and three endpoints, `passive.go` for pairing codes and links, `tlsid.go` for identity, `ratelimit.go` for rate limiting); CLI in `server/cmd/persona-link/passive.go`.

### Listener and identity

- Listens on `passive.listen` in link.json, default `:18663` (all addresses); change with `persona-link mode passive --listen <address>` or `pair --listen <address>`. Only this one port is opened.
- TLS 1.2 or later, ALPN only `http/1.1`. Identity is the helper's own ECDSA P-256 key and self-signed certificate in `~/.persona/link-tls/` (directory 0700, `link.key` and `link.crt` 0600),
  generated on the first `pair --listen` or first listener start. The certificate contains only `connector.persona.invalid`, no hostname or addresses (anyone connecting to this port can see the certificate).
- Fingerprint format matches the hub's: SHA-256 of the certificate's SubjectPublicKeyInfo DER, unpadded base64url (43 characters). The hub pins the fingerprint from the pairing link and doesn't validate the certificate name.
- Certificate lifetime is one year; with fewer than 30 days left it is renewed with the same key (also while listening, checked during handshakes), keeping the fingerprint. Changing the key (deleting `link-tls/`) requires re-pairing. These are configured values.

### Pairing

The direction is reversed from active mode (the computer may not be able to reach the hub):

1. On the computer: `persona-link pair --listen [<listen address>] [--addr <address>]…` (menu bar App: select **Let the hub connect** in the pairing window, then **Generate pairing link**).
   It switches link.json to passive mode and generates a one-time pairing code (128 random bits, `jc_` prefix, only SHA-256 stored); **stdout contains only the link**, explanations go to stderr:

   ```text
   persona://connector?addr=<host:port>[&addr=<host:port>…]&fp=<helper fingerprint>&code=<one-time code>
   ```

   - `addr` may repeat, best first, always `host:port` (no scheme, IPv6 in brackets, URL-encoded as a whole). Without `--addr`, local addresses plus port are ordered like active-mode hub candidates:
     LAN (private IPv4, ULA) → public IPv6 (excluding temporary, deprecated and tentative addresses on Linux) → public IPv4; exclude loopback, link-local, tunnel and bridge interfaces
     (Docker, VPN, Tailscale…). If all interfaces are virtual (container eth0, NAS interface attached to a virtual switch), fall back to those, still excluding tunnels and bridges.
     If none remain, `pair --listen` errors asking for `--addr`; `install --listen` still installs the service and instructs you to run `pair --listen --addr` later. If `--addr` is supplied, only those addresses are used.
   - Codes expire after 10 minutes and can be used once; another `pair --listen` generates a new code and invalidates the old one. The previously paired hub can keep connecting until the new hub consumes the new code.
2. Paste the link into hub admin **Computers › Add Computer › Hub connects** (addresses can be edited and a proxy supplied). The hub connects with `fp` pinning and exchanges the code for long-term credentials through `POST /api/v1/connector/pair`:
   the hub generates the random token itself; the helper stores only its SHA-256.
3. Afterwards the hub uses that credential to open `stream` to the node, as in active mode.

### Endpoints

Only these four exist: no shell, files or port forwarding; streams can connect only to `~/.persona/node-attach.sock`. All other paths and methods return `404 {"error":"not_found"}`.
Errors are JSON: `{"error":"<code>","message":"<human-readable Chinese>"}`.

| Endpoint | Authentication | Request | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/v1/connector/pair` | One-time code | Body ≤ 16 KiB: `{"code","token","machine","hub_id","hub_name"}`; `code`, `token`, `machine` required (`token`: 32–512 printable ASCII characters, no whitespace), `hub_id`, `hub_name` optional but please include them | `200 {"version"}`; invalid fields: `400 bad_request` (not rate-limited, doesn't invalidate the code); wrong, expired or used code: `401 bad_code` (rate-limited) |
| `GET /api/v1/connector/info` | `Authorization: Bearer <credential>` | — | `200 {"machine","version","features","attention_rev"?}`: `machine` is the machine id supplied by the hub during pairing; `features: ["attention"]`: it takes the "Needs you" summary; `attention_rev`: the `rev` of the summary it holds (absent: none); missing / wrong credential: `401 unauthorized` |
| `POST /api/v1/connector/attention` | Same | One summary object (see "Needs you") and nothing after it but white space, the whole body ≤ 64 KiB | `204`; no `rev`, anything else in the body or over the cap: `400 bad_request`; missing / wrong credential: `401 unauthorized` |
| `GET /api/v1/connector/stream` | Same | WebSocket upgrade; optional `X-Persona-Ping` (heartbeat, below) | Authenticate, connect node-attach.sock, then upgrade: node unreachable: `503 node_unavailable` (`message` gives the reason for the hub to record as this computer's error); non-upgrade request: `400`; after upgrading, see below |

- Successful pairing replaces the previously paired hub ("only trusts the hub it paired with": the group's primary; a new primary re-pairs after a switch). Old credentials stop working immediately, and streams opened with them close with code **4002**.
- Streams are binary messages containing unchanged node bytes in both directions. Accepts permessage-deflate without context takeover, as active-mode streams use it (SSH formerly used `Compression=yes`); a manager that still asks for context takeover gets none.
  The helper pings every 10 seconds and disconnects after 5 seconds without pong, while answering hub pings normally. When the hub closes a stream, the helper half-closes the node connection (write end), letting the node finish reading and clean up; the stream ends when the node closes.
  With a heartbeat configured in hub.json (`link`), the stream request carries `X-Persona-Ping: <interval milliseconds> <timeout milliseconds>`; the helper uses it on that stream (also clamped to 50 milliseconds–10 minutes);
  absent or not two numbers, it uses its own values. Old helpers ignore the header and retain 10 seconds / 5 seconds.
- Each stream is a new attach to the resident node, replacing the previous one as in active mode and SSH; the helper itself doesn't decide which is newest.
- When the helper stops or changes back to active mode, streams close with **1001**. Passive pairing stays in link.json; switching back to passive makes the same credential usable again.

### Authentication and rate limiting

- Only the credential hash is stored (`passive.token_sha256` in link.json), compared in constant time.
- Failed authentication (wrong code, missing / wrong credential) is counted per source: one IPv4 address or one IPv6 /64. **LAN and loopback count too** (the hub is usually on the LAN, which must not exempt it).
  10 failures within 60 seconds block the source for 15 minutes; blocked sources are rejected before authentication, returning `429 {"error":"rate_limited"}` and `Retry-After` (seconds) even with correct credentials. At most 4096 sources are tracked;
  when full, unblocked ones are evicted first. These are configured values, not measured results.
- A request must arrive whole within 30 seconds, body included (headers within 10): when the body stalls, the helper answers (`400` on pairing) and closes the connection, so a peer that never authenticates cannot hold one longer. An upgraded stream is not bound by this.
- Logs: at most one line per 30 seconds for authentication and TLS handshake failures (with the number omitted); sources are recorded only as /24 or /64.

### Recommendations for hub implementers

- Try `addr` values in link order (or start with only the first), and remember the working one; use edited addresses if the user changes them in admin.
- Back off on 401; don't keep retrying bad credentials (you'll block your own source). On 429, wait for `Retry-After`.
- Stream closed with 4002: another hub paired this computer; mark **Pairing required** and don't retry. On 1001 or connection failure, back off and reconnect normally.
- 503 `node_unavailable`: the link works but the resident node isn't running; show `message` as this computer's error and retry later.
- To check helper liveness and RTT: `GET /api/v1/connector/info`. The helper records the hub's last visit time and source, displayed in the menu bar and `persona-link status`.

### Passive mode in link.json

```json
{"mode":"passive","passive":{"listen":":18663","hub_id":"…","hub_name":"Home","machine":"example-workstation",
 "token_sha256":"…","paired_at":"…","code":{"sha256":"…","expires":"…"}}}
```

- Separate from active-mode fields (`hub`, `machine`, `fp`, `token`, `endpoints`), neither overwrites the other; absent `mode` or `active` means active mode (old files still work).
- `persona-link pair <link>` (active) sets `mode` to `active`, `pair --listen` sets `passive`, and `mode` changes only the mode. A running persona-link checks link.json every second,
  switching when mode changes (closing the link or listener and opening the other); a changed listen address changes the port.
- `persona-link uninstall --purge` also deletes `link-tls/`.

### Security boundary

- Someone able to reach this port can do nothing without a code or credential, only see the certificate (no hostname or addresses) and 404; guesses are rate-limited, and both are random values of at least 128 bits.
- A hub holding the credential can only open streams to the resident node, with exactly the same capabilities as via SSH (the node protocol), no more.
- For 10 minutes until consumed, the pairing link grants pairing authority: don't paste it into an untrusted place. Its `fp` prevents the hub connecting to an impersonating helper.
- Firewall: open this TCP port only to the hub (or its proxy), not everyone. `pair --listen`, `install --listen` and `mode passive` all show a reminder, for example
  `sudo ufw allow from <hub address> to any port 18663 proto tcp`; likewise for routers and cloud security groups. With the Mac application firewall enabled, the system may ask whether to allow
  incoming connections on first listen (not tested).

## Needs you

The manager that carries this computer tells its Persona Link which agents wait for the user, so the menu bar App and the Windows tray can list them and notify while no web page is open (#2214).
persona-link only relays the summary into its status: it shows nothing itself, and nothing on this computer can answer or approve a card with it.

**What is in it**
- The list and the count are the web app's "Needs you" badge as it is (`stateCounts().badge` in `web/src/lib/sessions.ts`): agents whose row says "Needs you" (the same rows the web app gets; a card read
  just after its row does not count before the row says so), without quiet tasks' agents and the assistant's conversations;
  muted agents and agents waiting only on a question the assistant is still deciding on (`delegating`) stay. One item per agent, by its oldest card handed to the user; while it has none,
  by its oldest card (one the manager has not decided on yet, or a question the assistant is still deciding on). Cards of the same time go by id. An agent with no card that can stand for it
  (a terminal dialog, an MCP elicitation) is `screen`.
- Whether an item notifies is the phone's push rule, worked out by the manager into `notify`: only once one of its cards is the user's (the manager rang it, when the phone is pushed; not a question
  the assistant is still deciding on: such a question is pushed only once the assistant hands it to the user), and never for a muted agent (or one in a muted space;
  `server/internal/assistant/fleet_mutes.go`). An agent in a terminal dialog notifies once the screen card made for it is announced (a moment later, or when its dialog can be read),
  as the phone is pushed then; the web app rings such a dialog at once. Otherwise the web app's system notifications follow the same rule. Clients notify on `notify` alone
  and never work the rule out themselves; `muted` is only for showing the item muted. An item notifies the first time it shows with `notify: true`, which may come after it was listed
  without it: a question the assistant hands to the user keeps its `interaction_id` and `since`.
- A card made again (a screen card read again once its node is back, a card the manager takes back after a restart, a Codex card listed again) notifies only when the manager can tell it
  rang before: a screen card read again as the very card that rang (its own id; one matched only by its session is not). Any other comes back not notifying, until it rings again: fewer notifications rather than more. A hook's card waits in the manager
  while its node reconnects: it is the same card and keeps what it was. (Persona Link takes the first summary of a link as its baseline, so a card pushed before a restart does not ring
  there again either.)
- `spec/fixtures/attention` holds the manager and the web app to the same list, count and `notify`.
- Order: by when the agent started waiting (`since`), newest first, then by machine and session id. Past 20 items the oldest are cut, so an agent that just started waiting is always listed and can be notified.
  The same agents and cards always give the same summary.
- Scope: the agents of the manager that carries this computer; with one manager (the default), every agent.

```json
{"rev": "9f2c41d0a1b2c3d4", "needs_you": 3, "more": 0, "web_url": "https://hub.example.com/persona",
 "items": [{"machine_id": "laptop", "session_id": "<session id>", "title": "Fix the login redirect", "place": "Laptop · web › 2",
            "kind": "permission", "detail": "Bash: npm test", "muted": false, "notify": true, "interaction_id": "<card id>",
            "since": "2026-11-09T07:00:00Z", "route": "/s/laptop/<session id>"}]}
```

- `needs_you`: the count, muted and not-notifying items included; `items`: at most 20, newest first; `more`: the rest. Nothing needs you: `"needs_you": 0, "items": []`.
- `kind`: `permission` / `plan` / `question` / `screen`. `interaction_id`: the card's id (a screen card has one too); absent for an agent no card stands for. `since`: when it started waiting, RFC 3339 UTC to the second; absent when unknown.
- `title`, `place`: at most 80 characters, `detail` at most 60, the ellipsis that marks a cut included. The largest summary stays far below the 64 KiB post cap and the link's 1 MiB read limit.
- `route`: the web app's path for the session (`/s/<machine>/<session>`, percent-encoded); open `web_url` + `route`.
- `web_url`: the hub's https `public_url`, sub-path included (`devicewire.Config.web_url`); without one, in active mode the hub address of the link's hello, in passive mode absent.
  That address may have a self-signed certificate and be another origin than the one the user signed in to, so the menu bar App's own "Web address" setting wins.
- `rev`: a hash of the rest; the same summary has the same `rev`, so sending it again changes nothing.

**When it is sent**
- The manager works it out in `liveLoop` from the Live Activity's inputs (woken by session lists, cards and mutes, at most every 100 ms, and every 15 seconds) and hands it on only when it changed.
  The Live Activity's own count does not change: it leaves muted agents out and counts questions the assistant is still deciding on.
- Active mode: to a link whose hello listed `features: ["attention"]`, once right after `endpoints`, then on every change.
- Passive mode: `POST /api/v1/connector/attention` to a connector whose `info` listed `attention`, on every change; and again after an `info` read whose `attention_rev` is not the summary's
  (a post that failed, a connector that restarted). Not while the connector holds the hub off (`401`, `429`), as for `info` and streams.
- A computer waiting to be confirmed or marked `trust: "work"` gets an empty summary (`needs_you: 0`, no items, no `web_url`): the summary names every agent's work, which neither may read.
  That also takes back what a computer had when it may no longer have it, without the link reconnecting. It gets the summary once it may. While the hub cannot say which computers wait to be
  confirmed, nothing new goes to a computer that is not known to be a work one: what it has stays, and one that has nothing gets nothing (an empty summary and the full one back would ring every
  item again). A work computer gets the empty summary all the same.

**On the computer**
- persona-link puts the latest summary into its status as `attention`: the JSON line the menu bar App reads and `link.status.json` (`persona-link status`, the Windows tray).
- Active mode: the status is reset when the link drops and when it connects, so the last link's list never shows on the next one. Passive mode: the summary goes when another hub pairs,
  and after 2 minutes without the hub coming in (it may have answered the cards meanwhile); the hub's next `info` read sees that and posts it again.

**Old and new**
- Old persona-link: no `features` in its hello, so the manager sends nothing (an unknown type would be ignored anyway). Old connector: no `features` in its `info`, so it is never posted to.
- Old manager: ignores `features` and the extra `info` fields and sends nothing; persona-link's status has no `attention`.

## Presence

While you are at a computer whose menu bar App can notify you, the hub counts that computer as a desktop: a phone with "Phone Muted" on leaves to it the "Needs you" cards whose notifications the App handed to Notification Center (#2214).
This takes over the retired native Mac App's `register_desktop` behavior for Persona Link ([desktop.md](../desktop/desktop.md)). Active mode only: a computer in passive mode is no desktop yet, and its phone gets every card (see "Not yet").

**Who decides**
- The menu bar App, by what it sees on this Mac; the conditions and the lines it writes are under "Menu bar App" › "Presence".
- The App confirms a card only once it handed the card's notification to Notification Center, on the connection the card came on: `{"rang":{"conn":<link>,"interaction_id":"<card id>"}}` on persona-link's stdin, the id as the "Needs you" summary names it and `conn` that of the status line whose summary listed the card.
  A notification dropped before it was handed over (the card left a capped summary or was answered while it waited, the connection went), one Notification Center refused, or any while notifications are off, is not confirmed.
  A notification handed over is not always shown: Focus or Do Not Disturb on the Mac may still hold it back (see "Not yet").
- The command-line Link reports nothing (nothing writes its stdin): it cannot show notifications, so muting the phone for it would lose alerts. Nor does the Windows tray yet.

**persona-link** (`internal/link/presence.go`)
- `run --parent` reads stdin line by line; a line that is neither presence nor a confirmation is skipped, and the end of stdin still means the App went away.
- It keeps the latest presence line and forwards every one, the App's repeats included; it never repeats one by itself, so presence lapses when the App goes quiet.
  An active line older than 120 seconds counts as inactive.
- On the link: `{"type":"presence","active","notifies","ttl_ms"}` as the link comes up and for every presence line (`ttl_ms` is what is left of the 120 seconds since the App wrote it),
  and `{"type":"rang","interaction_id"}` for every confirmation that names this link (`conn`): persona-link numbers its links in the status line, rising with each link and not reused by a restarted persona-link, so a confirmation for an earlier link, still in the pipe when the link changed or persona-link restarted, is dropped.
  The number stays between the App and persona-link; the hub never sees it.

**The manager** (`internal/devices/presence.go`)
- Keeps the presence until when it heard it + `ttl_ms` (120 seconds when missing, at most 4 minutes), and reports its desktops to the hub in `devices.desktops`: one report at a time from one task, in order, a run of requests making one;
  on every presence it hears (each renewal), when a delivery may change which computers count (a confirmation never does: it only wakes the pushes waiting for it), after a `devices.state` when the list changed, and in full, as it is then, after the full `devices.state` each handshake sends.
  Another report may reach the hub before that state: the hub drops the entry of a computer it does not yet have as this manager's, and the full list after the state brings it back.
  Each says the TTL left, which the hub counts on its own clock. A separate event, so a renewal once a minute does not resend the apps' machine list.
- Counts only a computer that gets the "Needs you" summary as it is (see "Needs you" above): its Persona Link takes the summary, it is not waiting to be confirmed and not a work computer.
  While the hub cannot say which computers wait to be confirmed, none counts: the summary freezes then, so a new card would reach neither the computer nor the phone. A work computer never counts.
- Counts only while its link keeps up with the summary: it took one (each change then goes out at once), and no send failed since; only a summary taken again brings it back.
- The presence ends when the link drops or another link of the computer takes over, and when its time runs out.
- Keeps the confirmations on the link they came on: a new link starts with none; only cards the summary that link holds (or the one on its way to it) lists are kept. A confirmation changes no computer's being a desktop.
- **Which cards it leaves to Persona Link.** When it pushes a card, it works out with the summary's own rule whether the card is the one that stands for its agent, notifying, among the listed items (not in More).
  If so, the push waits until one of its Persona Link desktops with `notifies` confirmed that card on its current link, then until the desktops as they are then were reported, and then checks that the same link still is such a desktop with that confirmation; only then does it say `link_covered`.
  A link replaced or stopping meanwhile does not count, and the wait goes on for a confirmation that does. The App's confirmation is what lets the hub mute the phone at all; the hub then mutes only for a Persona Link desktop it still has a valid record of, and pushes the phone when it has none.
  The whole wait has one deadline, 2 seconds, and ends with the manager: past it, or without a desktop, the push goes to the phone. Another card of the same agent, a card past the cap (also one handed to the user late), and a card the App did not confirm go to the phone.

**The hub** (`internal/hub/desktops.go`)
- A computer of the sending manager's own, with `notifies`, is a Persona Link desktop for the TTL it says, counted on the hub's clock from when it takes it and at most 4 minutes; a mesh member's computer does not count yet.
- "Phone Muted" while only Persona Link desktops are active holds back a "Needs you" card (the APNs card push and the `interaction` WebSocket alert) only when its push says `link_covered` and one of that manager's Persona Link desktops is active.
  The hub does not judge which cards a Persona Link took over: the manager says. Cards without `link_covered`, "Agent finished", reply reminders, decisions, MCP forms and links, `POST /api/v1/notify` alerts and the Live Activity's start alert still go to the phone. A connected native Mac App mutes as before.
- The deadline is checked when an alert goes out, so a computer whose manager or App went quiet stops muting the phone once it passes (2 minutes after the App last spoke); the `desktops` event follows when it lapses, also when a manager's list arrives first and leaves it out.
- The `desktops` event lists a Persona Link desktop as `{"kind":"link","machine_id","device":"","name","since"}`, only to clients that list `desktops_link` (`docs/protocol/protocol.md`); others get the list as before.

**Old and new**
- Old menu bar App: writes neither presence nor confirmations, so a new persona-link reports nothing. New App with an old persona-link: the old one discards its stdin.
- Old manager: ignores the `presence` and `rang` messages, and its card pushes carry no `link_covered`, so a new hub mutes none of them for a Persona Link desktop. Old hub: ignores `devices.desktops` and `link_covered`. Either way the phone gets the cards.
- The iOS App lists `desktops_link`. Clients that do not (older iOS builds, Android, the web app) do not show Persona Link desktops; a phone with "Phone Muted" on still has the confirmed cards held back while one is active.

**Not yet**
- Passive mode: a connector has no way to send a confirmation back within the wait, so a computer in passive mode is no desktop, and the phone gets every card.
- Focus or Do Not Disturb on the Mac is not checked: a notification the App handed over may stay unseen there while the phone is muted for it.
- The web app still shows its own notifications while a Persona Link desktop is active.

## Credentials (active mode)

- A kind of device credential: kind `link`, role `link`, bound to that machine in hub.json (`device_tokens.machine_id`, migration 0131).
  - The hub stores only the hash.
  - Can open only `/api/v1/link` and `/api/v1/link/stream`; every other endpoint returns 403.
  - Visible and revocable in App **Settings › Devices**; revocation immediately disconnects the link (4002).
  - Deleting the computer in the admin console revokes them too, and adding a computer from the admin console, an app or
    `personad hub pair --add` first revokes any left under its id, so an earlier computer of that id does not come back as
    the new one.
- Both kinds of pairing code can be exchanged for it:
  - `personad hub pair --machine <id>`: a code specifically for this computer (`pair_tokens.machine_id`). The link is `persona://link?…&machine=<id>`,
    exchangeable only for this computer's link credentials and nothing else. Stdout contains only the link, explanations go to stderr for easy piping.
    If the computer isn't in hub.json yet, add `--add [--name <name>]`: first adds `kind: link` (effective while running, no restart), already confirmed; without `--add`, it asks you to include it.
  - **Add Computer** in a signed-in App / web (`POST /api/v1/auth/pair-codes` with `add`, [protocol.md](../protocol/protocol.md), "Temporary pairing"): the hub adds `kind: link` just like admin's **Add Computer**,
    with a code for that machine. Computers added this way are **pending confirmation** and don't receive Persona-managed keys until the user taps **This is my computer** in the App ([protocol.md](../protocol/protocol.md), "Computer trust").
  - A normal App pairing code (`personad hub pair`) plus a machine id: CLI `persona-link pair --machine <id>`, or fill in **Machine id** in the App.
- The hub needs TLS (`public.tls_listen`) or an `https://` reverse-proxy `public_url`; without either, `--machine` returns 409.
- Failed authentication follows the hub's existing rate limits (public sources counted). Public connections require TLS; LAN plaintext isn't accepted either, except loopback
  or a LAN reverse proxy reporting HTTPS (`X-Forwarded-Proto: https`; see "[Hub behind a reverse proxy](#hub-behind-a-reverse-proxy)").
- Credentials are stored in `~/.persona/link.json` (0600): hub id, machine id, fingerprint (or `"trust": "system"`: no fingerprint, system-CA validation), credential, candidate addresses (hub-provided plus manually added).

## Connecting a computer (Mac example)

Prefer adding it in the App: no admin interface or sign-in to the hub machine needed. Below is active mode on Mac; for Linux, replace steps 2 and 3 with pasting the web app's one-line command into that computer's terminal;
for Windows see [windows.md](windows.md). Instructions for people who don't use terminals are in [getting-started.md](getting-started.md), "Connect a computer".

1. Install Persona Link on the Mac: `./scripts/app/mac-link.sh install` ([persona-link-install.md](persona-link-install.md)). It builds (including persona-node), copies to `/Applications`, and opens;
   first launch installs the resident node (`com.persona.node`), leaving existing installations untouched.
2. In the signed-in web app, open **Machines › Add Computer**, select Mac and enter a name (Chinese is allowed; the hub generates the id from the name). The hub adds `kind: link`, **pending confirmation**, and provides its pairing link
   (`POST /api/v1/auth/pair-codes` with `add`, [protocol.md](../protocol/protocol.md), "Computer pairing codes"). iOS and Android entry points are in progress.
3. Send the link to this Mac (**Copy pairing link** or **Share…**) and paste it into **Menu bar › Pair / Change connection…**.
4. Once it connects, the same web screen asks "A computer wants to join: <name>. Is it yours?"; tap **This is my computer** (`POST /api/v1/machines/{id}/confirm`).
   Before confirmation it receives no Persona-managed keys, isn't considered for assistant-machine selection, and doesn't appear in the computer list for creating Agents; unconfirmed computers are removed after 24 hours ([protocol.md](../protocol/protocol.md), "Computer trust").
   If you closed that screen, its card in the machine list also lets you confirm or delete it.
5. Verify: the menu bar icon becomes connected, the menu says **Local node online**, and the computer is online in App **Settings › Machines**.
6. To connect on startup, enable **Launch at login** in the menu (`SMAppService`).

Links expire after 10 minutes and are single-use; if expired, tap **Regenerate** on the web screen (`{"machine": <id>}` issues a new code and also revokes old Persona Link credentials).
Without hub TLS, the web reports "The hub hasn't enabled a secure connection yet" (409 `tls_required`); see "Advanced" below.

### Advanced

- **Add without the App** (already confirmed): admin **Computers › Add Computer › Computer connects**; or generate a pairing link on the hub machine:
  - Native deployment: `personad hub pair --machine macbook --add --name MacBook` (`--add` does nothing if the computer exists, but still returns a link);
  - Docker on NAS: `sudo /usr/local/bin/docker exec personad /opt/persona/bin/personad hub pair --machine macbook --add`.
- **Hand-edit hub.json**: add a `machines` entry (or change the previous SSH entry) to `{"id":"macbook","name":"MacBook","kind":"link","icon":"laptop"}`, restart the hub, then generate the link with the command above.
- If claude is a shell wrapper function, configure its launcher in `machines[].launchers` in hub.json.
- **CLI pairing**:
  ```sh
  … | "/Applications/Persona Link.app/Contents/Helpers/persona-link" pair -
  ```
- **Passive mode**: replace steps 2 and 3 with **Let the hub connect** in the pairing window, then paste the link into hub admin **Computers › Add Computer › Hub connects** ("Passive mode" above).

For Linux see "Linux (headless)" below: build `persona-link`, then `persona-link install --pair -` pairs, installs and waits for connection in one command.

## Menu bar App (`apple/PersonaLink/`)

**Build**
- `./scripts/app/mac-link.sh build|install|snapshot <directory>`.
- A standalone SwiftPM package (not in `apple/project.yml`, no shared code with the Persona App), built with `xcodebuild`: on this development machine, `swift build`'s default build system reports "Developer directory not found".
- persona-link and persona-node are built into `Contents/Helpers/` (persona-node is for the resident node; see "The device's program").
- The App's newer text is in `Resources/Localizable.xcstrings` (en / zh-Hans / ja); the build copies its resource bundle into `Contents/Resources/`.
  `scripts/i18n/apple_l10n.py check` checks that catalog apart from the apps' and keeps hard-coded Chinese or Japanese out of the Swift sources (`LINK_CJK`, now empty; text that must stay Chinese, such as persona-link's own output, is marked `// i18n-ignore`).
- Unit tests: `xcrun swift test --package-path apple/PersonaLink`; the Apple CI packages lane runs them (`scripts/ci/apple.sh`).
- Local ad-hoc signing (Sign to Run Locally), no hard-coded team.
- Default bundle id is the placeholder `com.example.persona.link`, overrideable by `mac.link_bundle_id` in `~/.config/persona/config.json` or environment variable
  `PERSONA_LINK_BUNDLE_ID`.
- After building, `vtool` changes the executable's recorded SDK version to the actual SDK used: xcodebuild records Swift packages as deployment target 15.0, making the system draw menu bar panels in the old SDK style
  ([lessons/macos.md](../lessons/macos.md), "Persona Link's panel kept the old appearance").
- `UNIVERSAL=1` also builds Intel.

**System settings**
- No Dock icon (`LSUIElement`).
- No sandbox: needs sockets and config in `~/.persona`.
- Info.plist registers both `persona` and `persona` URL schemes (#4198): opening `persona://link?…` in Notes, AirDrop, mail or Safari opens and prefills the pairing window; see "Pairing window" below.
  The App is not signed and notarized: on first launch, right-click it in Finder and choose Open to pass Gatekeeper. The schemes are registered only after the App has been opened once; earlier link taps cannot open it.
  If the Mac App (`PersonaMac`, which also registers both schemes) is installed on the same Mac, the system may send the link there instead: it recognizes `link` and forwards to Persona Link (found by executable `PersonaLink`, with configurable bundle id). If Persona Link is absent, it asks you to install it rather than pairing with that link; Persona on iPhone says "Open this link on the computer you want to add."
- Info.plist includes `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription`: from macOS 15, LAN connections require local-network permission, and the first prompts the user.
  If denied, LAN candidates report unreachable; enable it in **System Settings › Privacy & Security › Local Network**.

**Helper**
- The App starts it with `persona-link run --parent`.
- Stdout emits one JSON status per line; the App reads the latest.
- Stderr appends to `~/.persona/link.log`; if over 1 MB, it is cleared on the next helper start.
- Uses the resident node's data directory: if the App environment lacks `PERSONA_HOME` / `PERSONA_HOME`, it reads the directory from `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.persona.node.plist` and passes it to the helper; otherwise defaults to `~/.persona` (`~/.persona` on machines that used the old version) (`LinkStatePaths.swift`).
- `--parent` exits the helper when stdin closes, so any App exit, including a crash, also exits the helper.
  The App also writes presence lines to that stdin (see "Presence" below).
- If the helper exits, the App restarts it: exponential delay from 1 second to 30 seconds; after running for a full minute, restart delay resets to 1 second.

**Icons**: template images remain clear on light and dark menu bars.

| State | Icon |
| --- | --- |
| Connected (passive: hub connected) | `personalhotspot` |
| Connected, waiting for confirmation on your phone (`pending`) | `hourglass` |
| Connecting | `arrow.triangle.2.circlepath` |
| Passive listener waiting for hub | `antenna.radiowaves.left.and.right` |
| Offline or error (passive: can't listen) | `personalhotspot.slash` |
| Unpaired | `link.badge.plus` |
| Link connected, but Persona's background service (resident node) on this computer is not running | `exclamationmark.triangle` |

**Menu**
- Second line is the mode: **Connect to hub (active)** or **Let hub connect (passive) · Listening :18663**.
- Active: selected address (LAN / public IPv6 / domain / SSH), connection duration, disconnect reason (one line per candidate or plain-word SSH tunnel failure), local node online state.
- Passive: hub connected (source address, duration, local node state); or listening (when and where the hub last connected); or waiting for pairing (remaining validity of the pairing link);
  or unable to listen (port occupied, etc., retry delay).
- Connected hub and group size: "hub ‘Home’ · 3 hubs in linked group", or "hub ‘Home’ · Not linked to other hubs" when alone; disconnected shows only the name.
  Old hubs sending no name omit the line, preserving the previous menu.
- The first line describes the state plainly: unpaired is "Not connected to hub yet" (menu action "Paste pairing link…"); "Connected to hub"; awaiting confirmation is "Waiting for confirmation on your phone" plus "Tap ‘This is my computer’ in the phone App";
  if the resident node is not running, "Persona's background service on this computer is not running", with **Reinstall** in the menu (`persona-link node uninstall` then `node install`, preserving the node program in `~/.persona/bin`); "Connecting" or "Offline".
  "Waiting for confirmation" uses status-line `pending`: the hub does not yet send this field (#4655), so this period currently shows "Connected".
- **Reconnect now** (not in passive mode, where the hub initiates), **Pair / Change connection…**, **Install local node service** (only when absent), **Set Web Address…** (while the hub sends a "Needs you" summary, or once an address is set), **Launch at login**, **Quit**.

**Needs you** (the status line's `attention`: the hub's summary of the sessions waiting on you; without it the menu and the icon are as above)
- The icon: the count (`needs_you`, muted sessions included) beside the symbol, `99+` above 99; nothing at 0.
- The menu: a **Needs You** section under the status block with the first 5 sessions in the hub's order (latest `since` first): title, the card's kind and detail ("Permission: Bash: npm test"), place.
  A muted session (`muted`) is listed dimmed, with a muted bell; `muted` changes only how it looks. **And N More…** counts the rest (the ones the hub left out included) and opens the web app's root. An empty summary says "Nothing needs you right now".
- Notifications (`UNUserNotificationCenter`): one per session, identifier `<machine_id>/<session_id>#needs` (the web app's tag), only for items with `notify: true`
  (the manager applies the phone's push rule: not for a muted session, nor for a question the assistant is still deciding on; a missing `notify` counts as false).
  A card notifies once per connection, the first time it has `notify: true`, also when it was listed before without it (the assistant handed you its question); a card whose notification is still shown does not notify again.
  The cards already notifying in a connection's first summary make none (the web app's baseline rule). A newer card of a session replaces the older notification once its own goes out; when it does not notify, or its post is dropped, the older one is taken back. A session that leaves the summary, or no longer waits on the card its notification shows, takes the notification back, including one left from an earlier run of the App (a notification remembers its card).
  The summary goes away with the connection, so the next connection's first summary is a baseline again; a summary that does not decode changes nothing. A notification counts as shown only once it went out; one still waiting (behind the permission prompt) is dropped once its card is answered or replaced, it stops notifying, or the connection is gone.
  While the list is capped (`more` above 0, the oldest cut), a session missing from it may still wait: its notification stays (also one found at launch), and it does not notify again when it comes back; a post still waiting for it is dropped.
- Permission to notify is asked when the first summary arrives, not at launch (an older hub never sends one). Denied: the section says so, with **Turn On Notifications…** (System Settings › Notifications).
- A row or a notification opens `<web address> + route` in the default browser. The web address is **Set Web Address…** if set, else the summary's `web_url`
  (the hub's https public URL; in active mode without one, the hub address the link went to, which may have a self-signed certificate and is another origin than the one you signed in to).
  Set the web address when the hub has no https public URL. Without either (passive mode, no public URL), the section says so, and a row or a notification opens the **Web Address** window; saving an address there opens what was clicked, unless a later click already opened it. A typed address without a scheme is saved as https.

**Presence** (`Presence.swift`: the App's part of "Presence" above)
- `active` is true only while all of these hold:
  1. Keyboard, mouse or trackpad input within the last 5 minutes, as the HID system sees it (`CGEventSource`, no permission needed).
     Reading, a call or a long build without touching the keyboard keeps the phone quiet; a Mac left unlocked hands the alerts back to the phone 5 minutes later.
  2. The screen is not locked (`com.apple.screenIsLocked` / `com.apple.screenIsUnlocked`, distributed notifications macOS posts without documenting them).
  3. The displays are awake (`NSWorkspace` `screensDidSleep` / `screensDidWake`).
  4. This user's session is on screen, not switched away from (`NSWorkspace` `sessionDidResignActive` / `sessionDidBecomeActive`).
  5. `notifies` is true.
- `notifies`: Persona Link's notifications are allowed and shown as banners or alerts. Quiet delivery and the None style reach only Notification Center, so they do not count;
  neither does a permission not asked yet (the App asks when the first "Needs you" summary arrives). Focus on this Mac is not checked.
- The lock and session state at launch come from `CGSessionCopyCurrentDictionary`, the displays' from `CGDisplayIsAsleep`; the notifications keep them current. Notification settings are read again at most once a minute.
  The lock notifications are observed with `deliverImmediately`: AppKit otherwise holds distributed notifications back while the App is not active, which a menu bar App almost never is.
- One JSON object per line on the helper's stdin: `{"presence":{"active":true,"notifies":true}}`.
  - Written at once when either field changes, again every 60 s while `active`, and once to every helper as it starts (inactive too).
  - Idle time is checked when it would pass the limit; while only input is missing, every 10 s; while notifications do not show, once a minute. While locked, asleep or switched away, nothing runs until the next notification.
  - The pipe does not block: a helper that stops reading loses lines instead of stalling the App, and a helper that has gone fails the write (`EPIPE`; SIGPIPE is ignored).
- `{"rang":{"conn":<link>,"interaction_id":"<card id>"}}` on the same stdin once a card's notification went to Notification Center (`UNUserNotificationCenter.add` succeeded), on the connection it was for, `conn` being the status line's `conn` that brought the card's summary; nothing for a notification that was dropped, refused or not allowed, nor with a helper whose status line has no `conn`.
  A confirmation lost (no helper, a full pipe) leaves the card to the phone.

**Pairing window**
- Select **Connect to hub (active)** or **Let hub connect (passive)** at the top, defaulting to the current mode; viewing doesn't switch. Switching happens when pairing (active: paste and pair; passive: generate link),
  or by tapping **Use this** (that mode was paired before, no re-pairing, `persona-link mode`).
- Active: paste the pairing link from **Add Computer** on the phone or web, or open it directly (the URL scheme opens and prefills the window). **Never pairs automatically**: first shows the destination hub (`url` host),
  "Security fingerprint included" when `fp` is present, and this computer's name on the hub. Pairing runs only after the user taps **Pair**: a forwarded or forged link cannot hand this computer to someone else's hub on its own.
  Only accepts host `link`; other links such as `persona://pair?…` show "This link is for the phone / Mac App", without prefilling or taking further action.
  Machine id is under **Advanced** (only when the link lacks `machine`, such as `personad hub pair` without `--machine`). **SSH tunnel** is a closed-by-default disclosure section below the pairing link for setting, testing, editing or removing an SSH tunnel before or after pairing (see "[SSH tunnel](#ssh-tunnel)" above). The App calls `persona-link pair` (and `persona-link ssh`), displaying success or errors in the window. Lists candidate addresses (including an **SSH** row when a tunnel is configured) and marks the selected one **In use**;
  manual addresses can be added (`persona-link address add`) and removed.
- Passive: enter listen address (default `:18663`); **Generate pairing link** calls `persona-link pair --listen`, showing the selectable link with **Copy**, its addresses and firewall guidance;
  if already paired, shows which hub and this computer's name.

**Screenshots**
- `./scripts/app/mac-link.sh snapshot <directory>` renders the App's own views offscreen, a light and dark set each:
  - Every menu state, including "Needs you" with none, one, five (all four kinds, one muted), an item that does not notify without being muted, more than the menu lists, the longest text the hub sends, notifications off, and no web address;
  - Pairing window and the web address window;
  - Every icon, and the icon with a count.
- No screen-recording permission needed, and no unrelated content captured.

## Status line (helper → App)

```json
{"state":"connected","machine":"macbook","hub_name":"Home","mesh_hubs":1,"address":"https://192.0.2.10:18662","kind":"lan",
 "since":"…","node":"online","endpoints":[{"url":"https://192.0.2.10:18662","kind":"lan"}]}
```

- `mode`: `active` / `passive`.
- `state`: `unpaired` / `connecting` / `connected` / `waiting` / `refused`; passive mode uses `unpaired` (listening, waiting for pairing), `listening` (paired, hub not connected),
  `connected` (hub has a stream open; `address` is the hub's address and `since` the stream start time), `waiting` (unable to listen).
- Passive mode also includes `listen` (listen address), `addrs` (local addresses usable by the hub, `host:port`, best first), `last_seen` and `from` (time and address of the hub's last visit),
  `code_expires` (expiration of the `pair --listen` code).
- `node`: `online` / `offline` / `unknown`, reason in `node_error`.
- `pending` (planned, #4655): `true` means the hub is waiting for the user to confirm this computer in the App; absent means confirmed.
- `waiting` / `refused` include `error` (candidate failures separated by "；", a full-width semicolon) and `retry` (next attempt time); when an SSH tunnel attempt failed, `ssh_error` carries `{code, server, target}` so localized surfaces render the sentence in `en`, `zh-Hans` or `ja`.
- `ssh`: the active-mode SSH tunnel from `link.json` (`{server, target, always?}`), when configured; while connected through the tunnel, `kind` is `ssh` and `address` is `<server>`.
- `hub_name`, `mesh_hubs`: see "Hub name and linked group"; absent with old hubs.
- `machine_name`: what the hub calls this computer (see "The computer's name"); absent with old hubs. `rename`: how the last rename asked of this persona-link went: `{id, name}` or `{id, code, error}`.
- `pending`: meaningful only when `connected`; `true` means the hub is waiting for the user to confirm this computer (see "Pending confirmation"); absent or `false` means confirmed.
- `trust`: `system` when active mode validates the hub through system CAs (reverse proxy, no fingerprint); absent when pinned.
- `conn`: active mode while `connected`: which link it is, a number that rises with each link (across mode switches) and that a restarted persona-link does not reuse (it starts from the time it started). The menu bar App's confirmations name it (see "Presence"); absent otherwise and with old helpers.
- `attention`: the hub's latest "Needs you" summary, as it sent it; the full shape is in "Needs you". In short: `needs_you` (the count), `items` (at most 20,
  newest first, each with `machine_id`, `session_id`, `title`, `place`, `kind`, `detail`, `muted`, `notify`, `route`, and `interaction_id`, `since` when known), `more` (the rest),
  `web_url` (where `route` opens; in active mode the manager already fell back to the hub address when the hub has no https `public_url`, so the App needs no fallback of its own;
  absent in passive mode without one) and `rev` (the same summary has the same `rev`). Notify only items with `notify: true` (an item without it does not notify), also one listed before without it;
  `muted` only shows an item muted.
  Absent before the first summary, with old hubs, when the link drops or reconnects, and in passive mode once the hub stopped coming in for 2 minutes. A computer that may not have it
  (waiting to be confirmed, or a work computer) has an empty one (`needs_you: 0`, no items).
- No credentials included.
- Each line is also written to `~/.persona/link.status.json` (with `pid`, `version`, `updated`; normal exit writes `"state":"stopped"`) for
  `persona-link status` to read, since it can't query the running instance.

## Linux (headless)

On servers, NAS boxes and Raspberry Pis without a GUI, `persona-link` alone is enough.

**Build**
- Pure Go, no cgo: `cd server && CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -o persona-link ./cmd/persona-link`.
  Builds for `amd64`, `arm64` and 32-bit Raspberry Pi (`GOARCH=arm GOARM=7`); Windows also builds (file locks and signals in platform-specific files), with a tray icon instead of the menu bar App ([windows.md](windows.md), "Tray").
- `personad` also builds for Windows (`GOOS=windows go build ./...`; process groups, signals, file locks and CPU time are platform-specific in `internal/osproc` and each package's `_windows.go`),
  and the Windows resident node works with Orca; `persona-link install` installs a sign-in scheduled task on Windows (the Windows paragraph under "Install the node service"), see [windows.md](windows.md).
- The resident node runs the device's program, persona-node, built from the same commit (`~/.persona/bin/persona-node`; personad where the computer has no persona-node or runs a hub or a manager, "The device's program"); `scripts/deploy/node-launchd.sh install` installs a personad node on Linux as systemd user service `personad-node`.

**One-command installation**

Get the link from signed-in web **Machines › Add Computer** (requires confirmation on the web), or generate it on the hub machine via CLI (already confirmed):

```sh
personad hub pair --machine nas --add             # On hub machine; adds it if absent; stdout contains only the link
./persona-link install --pair - <<< '<link>'       # On this computer; reads link from stdin
```

Passive mode: `./persona-link install --listen [:18663] [--addr <address the hub uses to reach this computer>]`; after installation, prints a link for hub admin.

`install` runs these steps:
1. With `--pair`, pair first (same as `persona-link pair`; no link after `--pair`, or `-`, reads stdin). With `--listen`, switch to passive mode and generate a link if never paired
   (same as `pair --listen`); an existing pairing stays unchanged. These options can't be combined.
2. Copy itself to `~/.persona/bin/persona-link`, unless already there. Running `install` again with a new version upgrades it.
3. If absent, install and start the resident node service (systemd user service `personad-node`, same contents as `scripts/deploy/node-launchd.sh`): runs `~/.persona/bin/persona-node`, else `~/.persona/bin/personad` (the install script puts one there first),
   or `--node-bin <path>` / `--personad <path>` to copy a supplied binary. Existing installations stay unchanged; `--no-node` leaves it alone.
4. Write `~/.config/systemd/user/persona-link.service` (under `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` if set), then `daemon-reload`, `enable`, `restart`.
5. If linger is off, suggest `sudo loginctl enable-linger <user>`: otherwise the user instance is absent when nobody is signed in, services stop at logout and don't start at boot.
6. Wait up to 20 seconds for hub connection and the hub's local-node check, then print a one-line conclusion. Connected: exit 0; not connected: print every candidate's failure reason, exit 1, leaving the service installed and retrying.
   Passive mode waits for listening (or explains why it can't), then prints the pairing link and firewall guidance.

The unit contains neither mode nor listen address: both live in link.json. Changing mode or port requires no service reinstall; the running persona-link switches within a second or two.

Running `install` before pairing starts the service as unpaired; later `persona-link pair` makes it adopt new credentials within seconds, without restart (checks link.json changes every 2 seconds, also while connected, **Reconnect** above).

Generated unit:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Persona link: keeps this computer reachable from the Persona hub

[Service]
ExecStart="/home/<user>/.persona/bin/persona-link" run --log "/home/<user>/.persona/link.log"
Environment="PERSONA_HOME=/home/<user>/.persona"
Environment="PERSONA_HOME=/home/<user>/.persona"
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
StandardOutput=null

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

- Paths use this computer's data directory (`~/.persona` for new installs, `~/.persona` on machines using an old version, or `PERSONA_HOME` if set; see [rename.md](rename.md)); both `Environment` lines pass the same directory to the service so it doesn't resolve another.
- Doesn't wait for `network-online.target`: user instances don't have this target, and persona-link retries itself.
- Status lines are for the menu bar App, not journal; logs go to `~/.persona/link.log` (`run --log`; at 1 MB, rotates to `link.log.1`, a configured value).
  On machines without persistent journals, ordinary users can't see user-service logs with `journalctl --user`, so logging doesn't depend on it.
- Sessions entered through `su`, `sudo -u`, `docker exec` lack `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, so `systemctl --user` can't find the user instance; install / status / uninstall
  fill in `/run/user/<uid>` if unset and present. This doesn't help if the user instance itself is absent (no linger and nobody signed in); prompts to enable linger or SSH in as that user before installing.
- Installing as root warns that the service runs as root with root's data directory, and the resident node must also run as root (the prompt hard-codes `/root/.persona`, but the actual directory is resolved by the rules above).

**Without systemd** (containers, some NAS systems)

`install` still pairs and copies binaries, then prints copyable alternatives and exits 1:
- Run in the background now: `nohup ~/.persona/bin/persona-link run --log ~/.persona/link.log >/dev/null 2>&1 &`
- At boot: cron `@reboot` with the same command;
- Synology: a user script triggered at startup in Task Scheduler, containing the nohup line above;
- Container: a small supervisor script as the main process (under `docker run --init`) that runs `persona-link run --log …` and `personad node --attach --supervised` and starts each again when it exits; restart policy `unless-stopped`, `~/.persona` mounted as a volume ([lessons/server.md](../lessons/server.md) "A node service in a Docker container on the hub's own NAS");
- supervisord, runit, s6, OpenRC: run `persona-link run --log …` in foreground and restart on exit, and the resident node the same way as `personad node --attach --supervised`.

Resident node likewise: `nohup ~/.persona/bin/personad node --attach >> ~/.persona/node-attach.log 2>&1 &`.

Two things to know about a node without systemd:
- **The hub updates it only when its supervisor says so.** systemd and launchd are recognized by the environment they set; anything else
  that starts the node again whenever it exits declares itself with `node --attach --supervised` (personad or persona-node; Linux and macOS).
  The machine then shows `can_deploy: true`, and Redeploy and the hub's node updates reach it as they reach any other computer
  ([node-update.md](node-update.md)). nohup, cron `@reboot` and Synology's Task Scheduler restart nothing: leave the flag out there. Such a
  node shows `can_deploy: false` ("not managed by launchd/systemd") and is upgraded by hand: replace `~/.persona/bin/personad` with the hub's
  own build for that platform (same version as the hub) and restart the node process. What the supervisor has to do:
  - Start the node again, with the same command line, whenever it exits. A normal update doesn't need it: the node runs the new program in
    place (exec, same process id), so the supervisor sees nothing. It matters when the new version crashes, or never confirms with the hub
    within three minutes: the rollback watchdog then puts the old file back and stops the node, and the restart runs the old program.
  - Stop and restart only the node's own process. The watchdog runs from the old program in a session of its own, outside the node's process
    group, so killing the group or the session leaves it alone; killing every process of the user or the container doesn't (a container
    stop is fine: on the next start the node finds the unfinished update and starts another watchdog).
  - Have a `ps` that reports a process's start time (`ps -p <pid> -o lstart=`; procps on Linux, macOS's own). BusyBox's can't: the machine
    then says "ps here cannot report a process’s start time…" instead of offering Redeploy. Install procps.
  - Keep the folder holding the node's program (the real file behind `~/.persona/bin/personad`) writable by the node's user: the new file is
    staged and swapped there, next to a backup of the old one.

  As on any other computer, only personad is updated: persona-link, herdr and the Agents' CLIs keep their versions. herdr's server runs in a
  session of its own and keeps its panes when the node restarts. Windows nodes still can't be updated by the hub ([windows.md](windows.md)).
- A container on the hub's own machine may not reach the hub at the hub's LAN address or public name (a NAS's policy routing sends the
  replies elsewhere; a default bridge network has no IPv6). Its bridge's gateway does reach it: pair with the link's `url` host replaced by the
  gateway address, and add `https://<gateway>:<TLS port>` with `persona-link address add` so it stays first ([lessons/server.md](../lessons/server.md)
  "A node service in a Docker container on the hub's own NAS").

**Status, logs, uninstall**

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `persona-link status` | Mode, link (address, duration; candidate failure reasons when disconnected), hub name and group size, local node, this computer's name on the hub (its id in parentheses when they differ), candidate addresses, systemd service (active / enabled / linger), pid and version, log location. Passive mode instead shows: listen address, listening or hub connected, paired hub and pairing time, hub's last visit time and address, helper fingerprint, local addresses usable by hub. Exit 0 when connected (also listening in passive mode), otherwise 1 |
| `persona-link status --json` | Same for scripts: `running`, `mode`, `paired`, `machine`, `machine_name`, `hub_id`, `hub_name`, `endpoints`, `ssh`, `trust` (`pin` / `system`), `link` (last reported status), `passive` (`listen`, `paired`, `hub_id`, `hub_name`, `machine`, `machine_name`, `paired_at`, `code_expires`, `fp`), `service`, `config`, `log`; `error` if link.json can't be read; no credential or hash |
| `persona-link logs [-f] [-n lines]` | Last 100 lines of `~/.persona/link.log` (change with `-n` / `--lines`); `-f` / `--follow` keeps following, including rotation; without a log file but with an installed service, reads journal. `log` is the same command |
| `persona-link uninstall` | Stop, disable and delete systemd user service (Windows: scheduled task), preserving credentials. Linux / Mac resident-node service remains (`node uninstall` removes it); on Windows the node shares the task and stops too, but `personad.exe` remains |
| `persona-link uninstall --purge` | Also remove credentials (link.json and `.lock` / `.run`), status, logs (including `link.log.1`), passive TLS identity `link-tls/`, `~/.persona/bin/persona-link`, and install-script `persona-link` alias (only if truly an alias); refuses while another persona-link is running (menu bar App, manually started). Revoke hub-side credentials in App **Settings › Devices** |
| `persona-link pair [--machine <id>] [--ssh <server> [--ssh-target <host:port>] [--ssh-always \| --no-ssh-always]] [<link>\|-]` | Active pairing, credentials (and optional SSH tunnel) saved to `~/.persona/link.json`. No link or `-` reads stdin; prompts to paste in a terminal and reads one line on Enter. If the link lacks a machine id (normal App code), specify `--machine` |
| `persona-link ssh [<server> \| --off] [--target <host:port>] [--always \| --no-always] [--test [--link <link>]] [--json]` | Show, configure, test or remove (`--off`) the active-mode SSH tunnel in `link.json` without re-pairing; see "[SSH tunnel](#ssh-tunnel)" |
| `persona-link pair --listen [<listen address>] [--addr <address>]…` | Passive pairing link (only link on stdout, for piping); default listen `:18663`; can't combine with pairing link or `--machine` |
| `persona-link mode [active\|passive] [--listen <address>]` | No arguments: display current mode (with passive listen address); supplied mode: switch, retaining both pairings; `--listen` alone changes passive listen address without switching mode |
| `persona-link node install [--node-bin <path> \| --personad <path>]` / `node switch [--to personad]` / `node status [--json]` / `node uninstall` | Resident node service (Linux systemd `personad-node`, Mac launchd `com.persona.node`); a new one runs `~/.persona/bin/persona-node` when there is one (else personad, and always on a computer that runs a hub or a manager), existing services stay unchanged; `--node-bin` puts the given program in under its own name. `switch` moves an existing service to persona-node (`--to personad`: back), whole or not at all ("The device's program" above). `uninstall` deletes neither program. On Windows the node shares persona-link's task; only `node status` exists |
| `persona-link discover [--wait <seconds>] [--json]` | Hubs heard on the LAN (mDNS), viewing only, no pairing; listens 3 seconds by default, `--wait` allows decimals up to 60; exit 0 if found, otherwise 1; any LAN host can advertise a name, so the text output shows control characters as `<ESC>` / `<U+XXXX>`, one line per hub (`--json` is for scripts and keeps the name as heard: JSON escapes C0 control characters, ESC included, but writes DEL and C1 characters U+0080-U+009F raw, so don't print it on a terminal) |
| `persona-link run [--parent] [--log <file>]` | Maintain the link in foreground, one JSON status per stdout line (see "Status line"); `--parent` exits on stdin close (used by menu bar App); `--log` writes there (rotates to `<file>.1` at 1 MB), not stderr. Used by systemd and the alternatives under "Without systemd" |
| `persona-link address add <address>` / `address remove <address>` | Manually add / remove a hub candidate (`https://domain:port`, or just domain), stored in link.json; pairing required before adding. `remove` deletes that entry, manual or hub-provided (the hub may send it again on next connect) |
| `persona-link name [<new>\|--reset]` | No argument: what the hub calls this computer (with the id when they differ). A name: asks the running, connected persona-link to have the hub rename this computer and prints the hub's answer; `--reset`: back to the id. Exit 1 with the reason when it can't (not running, offline, passive mode, a hub that doesn't rename computers, not confirmed yet, too long); see "The computer's name" |
| `persona-link version` | Print version (`--version`, `-v` equivalent) |
| `persona-link help` | Print usage (`--help`, `-h` equivalent); unknown commands / options also print usage and exit 2 |

`status` uses:
- Running: whether the file lock `~/.persona/link.json.run` is held (regardless of who started it: systemd, menu bar App, manual). It briefly acquires the lock to check;
  a persona-link starting at that exact moment exits as "already running", then systemd starts it again after 5 seconds.
- Link state: `~/.persona/link.status.json` (see "Status line"); when not running, shows the last report and time.
- **Does not connect to the resident node socket** to check liveness: every connection is a new attach and would replace the hub's current connection. Local-node status comes only from the hub.
- Also works on Mac (the menu bar helper writes the same status file); `install` on Mac only suggests installing the menu bar App.

`scripts/deploy/link-systemd.sh` remains a thin wrapper: `install` / `uninstall` / `status` delegate to `~/.persona/bin/persona-link`; `restart` runs `systemctl --user restart`.

**Verification** (2026-11-02): a clean Debian 12 container (arm64) in local Docker, with a test hub on the host listening only on 127.0.0.1; the container connects through
`host.docker.internal` to its TLS port. Everything was stopped afterwards.
- Without systemd: `install --pair -` pairs, copies and prints alternatives (exit 1); after the suggested `nohup … run --log …`, `status` shows connected and
  `logs` contains logs; starting a resident node makes the local node online and the hub machine list shows this computer online.
- With systemd (`--privileged --cgroupns=host`, image needs `libpam-systemd` or the user instance won't start; `loginctl enable-linger`):
  enter with `docker exec -u` (no `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`), install and connect with one `install --pair -`; after `scripts/deploy/node-launchd.sh install`, local node is online;
  container restart (equivalent to boot) reconnects automatically; disabling linger makes `status` suggest enabling it; another install (upgrade), install before pair,
  uninstall and uninstall --purge all behave as expected.
- amd64 version ran version and status in an emulated amd64 container. Not tested on a real Raspberry Pi / NAS.

## Use it away from home too

The link uses only the hub's TLS port. Away-from-home use also needs:
- DSM firewall allows 18662/tcp (not 18660).
- Router allows IPv6 inbound to NAS.
- Domain in hub.json `public.advertise` (DDNS points to NAS IPv6). After one connection the hub sends it to persona-link; it can also be manually added in the App.

IPv4-only networks can't reach a home IPv6 address, just as with the phone.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Passive: "Can't listen on :18663: port in use" | Another program owns it: change port with `persona-link mode passive --listen :18664` (then edit this computer's address in hub admin), or stop that program |
| Passive: hub can't connect, and "Last hub connection" in `status` never changes | Firewall / router doesn't allow the port; hub can't reach the link addresses (edit address or proxy in admin); fingerprint mismatch (deleted `link-tls/`: re-pair) |
| Passive: hub reports 429 | Too many failed authentications from that source (usually retrying old credentials); wait 15 minutes or restart persona-link to clear counters |
| `pair --listen` finds no address | Only loopback, tunnel or temporary addresses: use `--addr <domain or address the hub can reach>` |
| Menu says "Link connected, but hub can't reach local node" | Resident node isn't running: `launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.persona.node`; log at `~/.persona/node-attach.log` |
| Mac: sessions started from the phone never come up (Claude stays at "Loading commands and agents", no hook fires) | Run `personad node doctor`: `launchd-process-type` (launchd throttling the node; `--fix` rewrites the agent and reloads it) and `path-access` (a working directory, setting or skill link in Desktop / Documents / Downloads; grant Full Disk Access to the node binary, or move it out) (docs/server/server.md "Scheduling and privacy on the Mac") |
| "Hub rejects this computer's credentials" | Credentials revoked or hub database changed: re-pair |
| Reverse proxy: "Certificate not trusted by the system" / "Certificate hostname doesn't match" | Proxy certificate isn't public-CA signed, expired, or doesn't match `public_url`: fix certificate or `public_url`, then re-pair |
| Reverse proxy: hub returns HTTP 403 | Hub logs show `tls_required`: proxy on another machine lacks `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`, or hub treats its address as public (container gateway, public address); see "[Hub behind a reverse proxy](#hub-behind-a-reverse-proxy)" |
| Reverse proxy: HTTP 404 / 400, or immediate disconnect | Prefix not stripped, WebSocket not forwarded (`Upgrade` / `Connection` headers), or `proxy_read_timeout` too short |
| "This computer opened another link elsewhere" | Same link.json copied to another computer, or two persona-link instances running |
| LAN candidates "unreachable" though network works | Check local-network permission |
| Linux: `install` says "Can't reach your systemd user instance" | Entered through `su` / `sudo -u` / `docker exec` without linger: SSH directly as this user, or first `sudo loginctl enable-linger <user>` |
| Linux: link disconnects at logout and doesn't connect after reboot | Enable linger: `sudo loginctl enable-linger <user>` (`persona-link status`'s background-service line explains) |
| Linux: link connected, local node offline | Resident node isn't running: `systemctl --user status personad-node`; log at `~/.persona/node-attach.log` |

Logs:
- Helper / Linux service: `~/.persona/link.log` (`persona-link logs -f`); passive mode uses `passive: …` (listener start, pairing, stream start / end, rejected requests);
- Hub: `[<machine>] link up …` / `link down …`.

## How passive mode and the node service were verified (2026-11-02)

- Go tests (`server/internal/link/listen_test.go`, `server/cmd/persona-link/passive_test.go`) use a fake hub following section 4: pins the link fingerprint (a different fingerprint fails the handshake),
  pairs with the code and opens authenticated streams to a fake node in a temporary directory (echo); verifies 300 KiB random bytes unchanged both ways, wrong credential 401, correct credentials also 429 after rate limiting, single-use and expired codes,
  other paths 404, old credentials 401 and old streams closing with 4002 after re-pairing, missing node 503, helper disconnecting when hub doesn't pong, occupied port error and retry, switching between active / passive.
  Existing active-mode tests all still pass.
- Real binaries (temporary HOME, listening only on 127.0.0.1): `persona-link pair --listen` + `persona-link run` + real `personad node --attach`; after pairing, the fake hub sends node-protocol
  `ping` and `node.info` on the stream, and the resident node answers both.
- Clean Debian 12 (arm64) container with systemd: `curl … install.sh | sh -s -- --node --listen` (`docker exec -u`, no `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`), both user services active,
  link printed; a fake hub on the host pairs through a port mapped to 127.0.0.1 and talks to the real node in the container; both services restart themselves after container restart, and original credentials still work.
  On the first run the container's only interface was virtual, leaving no candidate addresses and blocking installation; this led to the "fall back when all interfaces are virtual" behavior.
- `persona-link discover` heard a temporary fake hub broadcast on the LAN (mDNS, stopped afterwards).
- Passive-mode screenshots of the Mac menu bar and pairing window (light and dark, `mac-link.sh snapshot`). The App's first-launch resident-node installation **was not run on a real machine**: this development machine has a real, actively used
  `com.persona.node` that must not be touched; Mac `node install` command sequences (`launchctl bootout` / `bootstrap`) were tested only with fake commands; the plist passed `plutil -lint`.
- Not tested: real hub dialing side (#435 in progress), SOCKS proxy, passive mode on Windows (compiled only; Windows active mode and scheduled task in [windows.md](windows.md)), public IPv6 inbound.
