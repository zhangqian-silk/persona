# Archive: point-in-time records

Only retain records with unique measurements, unresolved acceptance boundaries, or design decisions not captured by a maintained guide.
The records below describe their stated date, not the current product. Source filenames, immutable commit references and test counts may be historical;
local documentation links are kept current so readers can reach the maintained contract. Current module guides and lessons take precedence.

Development screenshots and recordings are not stored here. Keep new verification media outside the checkout and attach it to the associated PR.
Place necessary historical text under its module directory and list it below.
