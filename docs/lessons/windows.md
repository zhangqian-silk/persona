# Windows pitfalls

Read this before changing the Windows node (#1090), or developing or testing `personad` on a Windows computer. See [windows.md](../operations/windows.md) for the design and current status.

## Development environment

- **Check out the repository with LF endings**: Git for Windows defaults to `core.autocrlf=true`, so every checked-out `.go` file has CRLF endings. `gofmt -l` reports many files, and scripts and golden files can also fail to match.
  After cloning, run `git config core.autocrlf false && git config core.eol lf` in this repository, then `git rm -q --cached -r . && git reset -q --hard` to check it out again (commit or stash your changes first).
- **Unix socket paths must not exceed 108 bytes**: Go supports AF_UNIX on Windows, but a long path makes `bind` return `invalid argument` (not “unsupported”).
  Paths such as `~/.persona/node-attach.sock` are fine; do not put test sockets deep inside temporary directories (Claude Code's scratchpad exceeded the limit).
- **`/tmp` is not the temporary directory**: On Windows, `os.MkdirTemp("/tmp", …)` means `\tmp` on the current drive, which usually does not exist. Tests that need short paths should use platform-specific files (`listen_*.go` in `orcarttest`).
- **Windows Python has no `fcntl`**: a repository script that locks with `fcntl.flock` fails with `ModuleNotFoundError` under Git Bash. One that must run on a Windows dev machine locks with `msvcrt.locking` there (`LK_NBLCK` on the first byte, trying again while it raises `PermissionError`), as `scripts/hooks/merge-pr.sh` and `scripts/operations/pr_watch_merge.py` do; two programs sharing a lock file must lock the same byte (seek to 0 first: `open("a+")` starts at the end). Its `subprocess.run(["bash", …])` also searches System32 before PATH, where `bash.exe` is WSL's: take `shutil.which("bash")`.

## Processes and shells

- **`bash` may be WSL**: In the system PATH inherited by the service, `C:\Windows\System32\bash.exe` precedes Git. It runs commands inside WSL (another “Linux” machine, with its own claude and `~/.zshrc`).
  On Windows, node must always run shell scripts with Git for Windows bash (`loginShellProgram`, like Claude Code itself, honoring `CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH`). If it cannot be found, fail to start the command; do not fall back to bare `bash`.
  Use `interactiveShell()` wherever a launcher is started. The assistant, Codex assistant, and launcher-model listing each once hardcoded “bash if zsh is missing.” On Windows, the assistant's claude entered WSL
  and immediately exited with “open terminal failed: not a terminal”; the main chat did not respond, and there was nothing in the logs (#1994). Do not choose a shell independently in new launch sites.
- **A native path in a `bash -ic` script loses its quoting at the Git Bash boundary**: `shellQuote` closes and reopens its quotes around each backslash (`'C:'\\'Users'…`), which a POSIX shell reads back correctly, but Git Bash started as a native Windows process with the script as its argument eats an escape layer and ends with an unmatched quote ("unexpected EOF while looking for matching `''"). The assistant's launch (profile directory, a managed launcher's `personad`) exited about 200 ms after starting (#5487).
  Every script the node hands its shell as an argument with native paths in it (`-ic`, `loginShell`: the assistant's launch, Codex's app-server, the model list, the launcher and sign-in checks) quotes them with `scriptPath` and its launcher with `launcherForScript`: forward slashes on Windows (`C:/Users/…`, which Git Bash and Windows programs both take), and an apostrophe as `'"'"'` (a double quote survives the boundary, as `"$@"` does). Commands typed into a terminal (herdr panes) cross no such boundary and keep `launcherCommand`. Leave `shellQuote` and other arguments alone. `filepath.ToSlash` converts nothing when tests run on macOS, so replace `\` explicitly.
  The assistant's claude then has `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=C:/Users/…` while other starts have `C:\Users\…`: a directory read back from a running process is cleaned to backslashes (`scannedConfigDir`) before it is compared, or one profile is listed twice.
- **The arguments after a Git Bash script lose their quoting too**: Windows hands a program one command line, and `exec.Cmd` writes it for the MSVC runtime (`syscall.EscapeArg`: no quotes around an argument without spaces, `"` as `\"`). Git Bash splits it the MSYS way, where `\"` outside quotes is a backslash that opens a quote, so arguments with double quotes in them run together. Codex's `-c` TOML values arrived as one argument and the main chat started without the persona MCP server (18 arguments sent, 2 received; #6418).
  A command the node starts with Git Bash as the program calls `msysCmdLine` after setting `SysProcAttr`: it quotes every argument whole and sets `SysProcAttr.CmdLine`. Other programs keep Go's quoting.
- **Read other processes' environment variables from the PEB**: There is no `/proc` or `ps -E`. `procs_windows.go` lists processes with Toolhelp32, then uses `NtQueryInformationProcess` + `ReadProcessMemory` on candidates
  to read `RTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS` (command line, current directory, environment block). Pointers in the PEB are addresses in the other process: read bytes and extract fields using x/sys offsets.
  Do not read directly into a struct such as `windows.PEB` that contains Go pointer fields (the GC would treat the other process's addresses as its own pointers).
- **Environment-variable values can contain spaces**: Whitespace-splitting regexes such as `envVarRe` are for `ps -E`; they truncate `C:\Users\A B\.claude`. On Windows, fetch the complete value by name (`pickEnv`); names are case-insensitive.
- **There is no “foreground process group” or “suspended” state**: On Windows, the Orca host considers claude / codex foreground when its parent-process chain contains no agent process for the same pane. See [windows.md](../operations/windows.md) (“Orca”).
- **PIDs are reused quickly and do not increase monotonically**: Sorting by PID to put wrappers first does not work on Windows. Sort by start time; when walking the parent chain, require ancestors to have started before the current process.

## Paths the hub reads

- **A Windows node's paths reach a hub that may not be Windows**: the node reports directories as `C:\Users\…`, and on a Linux or macOS hub `filepath` splits only at `/`, so `filepath.Base` returns the whole path. `identity`'s directory checks (`IsAssistantDir`, `IsAssistantDirOf`, `SpaceOf`, `InHealthSpace`) missed the computer's assistant and health directories, and its main chat conversations never reached the Persona tab (#6419). `filepath.ToSlash` does not help there: it converts nothing off Windows.
  Code on the hub or a manager that takes apart a directory a node sent reads it through `identity.NodePath` first: a path with a drive letter or a `\\server\` prefix gets forward slashes on a hub that is not Windows, and anything else stays as it is. Test such code with Windows paths and run the test on Linux, not only on the computer you develop on.

## Scheduled tasks (automatic startup)

`persona-link install` registers scheduled tasks on Windows ([windows.md](../operations/windows.md), “Install and start at logon”). These findings were all tested on a physical Windows 11 machine on 2026-11-04:

- **Standard users cannot register “Run whether user is logged on or not” tasks**: With S4U `LogonType` (no stored password), `Register-ScheduledTask` returns access denied (even for an unelevated administrator account).
  Only `InteractiveToken` works, running with the login session.
- **“Restart on failure” does not cover program exits**: `RestartOnFailure` restarts only when the task cannot start. A program that exited with code 1 was not restarted even after 4 minutes. For supervision, add a trigger that fires every few minutes,
  with the `IgnoreNew` multiple-instance policy (do nothing if already running).
- **Repetition on a logon trigger starts only at the next login**: Immediately after installation, before another login, it will not start every 5 minutes. Use a separate time trigger for supervision (`StartBoundary` set to the installation time); it still fires on schedule after a restart.
- **Console programs open windows**: A task running a console program in the user session opens a console window for it (a Windows Terminal window if Windows Terminal is the default terminal).
  Have the task start a GUI-subsystem program instead (a copy with Subsystem in the PE header changed from 3 to 2), which starts the console program with `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`: a console, but no window.
- **Change the defaults**: `ExecutionTimeLimit` defaults to 72 hours, after which the task ends (set `PT0S`); `Priority` defaults to 7, “below normal” (set 5); by default it will not start on battery and stops when unplugged.
- **schtasks output uses the system code page** (GBK on a Chinese system), and the `/Query` status column is localized (Running / 正在运行, both meaning “running”): display it, but do not parse it.
  Write XML files as UTF-16LE with a BOM so Chinese characters in usernames and paths are not corrupted.
- **Ending a task kills only the daemon itself**: Its children survive. The daemon puts itself in a Job with `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` (subsequent children automatically join it),
  so when it disappears (`/End`, a crash, or a kill), its children disappear too.
- A running `.exe` cannot be overwritten or deleted. Before reinstalling, `/End` the task and wait for persona-link to release the run lock; during uninstall, the daemon file may take a moment to become deletable.

## Updating a running program (node updates)

`server/internal/nodeupdate`; see [windows.md](../operations/windows.md) ("Updates through the hub"). Found on a physical Windows 11 machine on 2026-11-12:

- **A running program's file cannot be replaced, but can be renamed**: `os.Rename(new, running.exe)` fails with access denied, while renaming `running.exe` away works. Move the old file aside, then put the new one in place; delete the aside file once its process is gone (deleting it earlier fails the same way).
- **Go's `os.Open` does not share delete**: a rename over a file this process (or any other) holds open fails with access denied. Close the file before renaming over it.
- **Only files ending in `.exe` start**: `exec.Command` on a staged `.node-update-stage-123` reports "executable file not found". Anything that is run (the staged build's self-check, the watchdog's backup copy) needs the suffix.
- **`FlushFileBuffers` needs a handle that may write**: `f.Sync()` on a file opened with `os.Open`, or on a directory, returns access denied. Open the file read-write to flush it; a directory cannot be flushed: use `MoveFileEx` with `MOVEFILE_WRITE_THROUGH` for a durable rename instead.
- **No inherited descriptors**: `exec.Cmd.ExtraFiles` is not supported, so a child cannot report readiness on fd 3. Report through a file both sides read.
- **A program runs from the file a process has open**: the watchdog runs from the backup it may restore, so the backup can only be moved aside, not deleted, until the watchdog exits.
- **A restart is a new process**: with exec the new program keeps the pid the rollback watchdog recorded; on Windows it does not, so a target build that never records itself (one from before Windows updates) kept running after a rollback put the old file back (found 2026-11-13 updating a node to a release without this support). Record the supervisor and find its children.
- **The image path follows a rename**: `QueryFullProcessImageName` returns where the program's file is now (the moved-aside name), while `Get-Process` / `Win32_Process.ExecutablePath` show the path it was started from. Match both.

## Claude Code's peer inbox (desktop app, other terminals)

Measured 2026-11-07 with Claude Code 2.1.308 / 2.1.291; see [claude-integration.md](../integrations/claude-integration.md) ("Claude outside Persona's terminals").

- **The inbox takes the message but the model may answer the wrong party**: Claude Code prefixes a peer's message with "Another Claude session sent a message" and tells the model to reply with SendMessage to `from=`. With no `from`, the first throwaway session answered "the session named Persona is unreachable" instead of "OK". The text must say the words are the user's own and to answer in the session (`prompts/agents/peer_message`).
- **A message without the `<cross-session-message>` envelope loses its sender and body in the transcript**: Claude Code fills `origin.name` / `origin.body` only from the envelope. Send the envelope, signed with `from-name`.
- **The inbox says nothing on the connection**: no ack, no error. Whether a message was taken shows only in the transcript (a `queue-operation`, or a hidden user line with a peer origin, within a few hundred ms). A bypass-permissions session holds every message without `from-mode` for the person at the computer; nothing reaches the transcript until it is approved.
- **Windows needs the auth line first**: the inbox drops any connection whose first line is not `{"type":"auth","token":…}`. The key file's name hashes the pipe path in lower case (`\\.\pipe\local\cc-msg-…`), not as `sessions/<pid>.json` writes it.
- **`entrypoint` is not always `claude-desktop`**: one desktop build writes `claude-desktop-3p`. Match the prefix.
- **`procStart` on Windows is a FILETIME** (100 ns since 1601) of the process's creation, not a Linux clock tick count; compare it with `GetProcessTimes` to tell a reused pid apart.
- **An interactive claude under a pseudo console needs its std handles to be the console's**: a `CreatePseudoConsole` child that inherits the parent's redirected stdout decides it is not on a terminal and runs as `--print` ("Input must be provided … when using --print"). Set `STARTF_USESTDHANDLES` with null handles.
- **Testing on a dev machine**: start a throwaway `claude` with its own `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (copy `settings.json`, write a `.claude.json` with `hasCompletedOnboarding` and the test directory trusted) and an empty working directory; never send into a session the user has open. The first failed start renamed the test `.claude.json` into `backups/`: write it again before the next try.

## Historical tray (WebView2, notification area)

Retired with the independent Link service (#6770); the implementation notes are in [windows-records.md](../archive/operations/windows-records.md) and [link-menu-tray.md](../archive/operations/link-menu-tray.md). These findings are historical, not a reason to restore a tray UI. Found on a physical Windows 11 machine on 2026-11-07:

- **WebView2 holds back its callbacks while one of them runs**: creating a WebView inside a `WebMessageReceived` handler gets the environment back, but the controller's completion waits until the handler returns.
  go-webview2's `Embed` spins a nested message loop until then, so it never returned: the pairing window stayed hidden, and the tray's thread stayed inside that loop (which also swallowed the quit message). Handle page messages after the event has returned (`app.fromPage` queues them).
- **go-webview2's `PutRasterizationScale` passes a pointer to the double**: the COM method takes the double itself. On windows/amd64 Go's syscall also copies the integer arguments into the XMM registers, so pass `math.Float64bits(scale)`, as its `PutZoomFactor` does.
  With the pointer, pages rendered at scale 0.5: `devicePixelRatio` was 0.5 and everything was half size.
- **go-webview2 clears `WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS`** (and the other override variables) before it creates the environment, so Microsoft's documented way to add `--remote-debugging-port` does nothing. Pass flags through `AdditionalBrowserArgs` (`PERSONA_TRAY_DEVTOOLS=<port>`).
- **Windows 11 puts new notification icons in the overflow**: UI Automation on the taskbar doesn't see them. `HKCU\Control Panel\NotifyIconSettings\<id>` (`ExecutablePath`, `InitialTooltip`) shows that the shell took the icon.
  A tray run from a temporary directory leaves an entry there; delete it after testing.
- **Tests must not touch the real registry**: the install tests once wrote the HKCU Run entry and the pairing link handlers, pointing at a test's temporary directory. Everything the tray does to the computer goes through `trayControl`, which tests fake.
- **A page that loses focus hides the flyout**: while scripting the panel over CDP, Playwright's clicks wait for it to be visible forever; click with `element.click()` in the page.
- **Push the new view to a hidden panel after an action**: the tray pushed views only while the panel was visible, so a switch flipped from the right-click menu, or an action that ended after the panel closed, left the page showing the old state, and the next open showed it too. After a user's action the tray pushes the view whether the panel is shown or not (`app.changed`).

## Codex

See [windows.md](../operations/windows.md) ("Codex") and [codex.md](../integrations/codex.md) ("Windows"). Found on a physical Windows 11 machine on 2026-11-07:

- **The Codex App's bus is a named pipe, not `<CODEX_HOME>/ipc/ipc.sock`**: `\\.\pipe\codex-ipc`, one per user session whatever the Codex home. Without it the App's chats stayed "view only" and nothing said why: the node looked for a socket file that never exists on Windows.
- **`os.Stat` on a named pipe connects to it**: Go's Stat opens the path with `CreateFile`. On a pipe that takes one of the server's free instances (a test listener saw a client arrive) or fails with "All pipe instances are busy".
  To see whether a pipe exists, list it (`FindFirstFile` on the full name; it does not connect).
- **go-winio pipes have no buffer by default**: `ListenPipe(name, nil)` makes a pipe whose write waits for the other side to read. A fake server that writes two frames in a row (the answer to `initialize` and its own question) deadlocked against a client
  writing its next request. The App (Node/libuv) has buffers, so the fake must too (`PipeConfig.InputBufferSize` / `OutputBufferSize`).
- **The `codex://` handler of an MSIX package has no `shell\open\command`**: `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\codex` has `URL Protocol` and nothing to run; the shell activates the package (`AssocQueryString` with `ASSOCF_IS_PROTOCOL` gives its AppUserModelID).
  Checking for a command finds none; check `URL Protocol` and ask `AssocQueryString`. Open it with `ShellExecute` on a thread with COM initialised, not `cmd /c start` (a console window) or `rundll32`.
- **Without `ps` / `lsof`, every Codex scan said "could not tell"**: the resume check took that for "held", so nothing broke, but every running CLI listed as offline history and the Codex App's stdio app-server was never seen.
- **Who holds a file open, fast**: a process's handle table (`NtQueryInformationProcess(ProcessHandleInformation)`), filtered to File objects, then `GetFileType` before `GetFinalPathNameByHandle`. Asking a pipe handle its name can hang behind a read pending on it; asking its type does not.
  Asking the file instead (`FileProcessIdsUsingFileInformation`, `RmGetList`) costs about 40 ms per file: seconds for a Codex home.
- **npm installs `codex` as `codex.cmd`**: `exec.LookPath("codex")` finds the batch file, and running a batch file has `cmd.exe` parse the arguments again, the first message included (`"`, `&`, `%`, line breaks). Run the `codex.exe` the shim's `codex.js` would start.
- **Codex's shared daemon does not start from npm's launcher on Windows**: `codex app-server daemon start` fails with "this Windows launcher prevents background processes from outliving it", so a plain `codex` 0.163 runs in its own process there.
- **A Codex `unix://` endpoint with a drive path is no URL**: `url.Parse("unix://C:\…")` fails on a port after host `C`. Parse the path as a path.
- **`os.Symlink` needs Developer Mode or an administrator**: about ten node tests that make symlinks fail on a standard Windows account ("A required privilege is not held by the client"); they are not Codex failures.

## Machine monitoring (sysmon)

`sysmon/windows.go`; see [machines.md](../server/machines.md) for measurement definitions. Findings tested on a physical machine on 2026-11-04:

- **`NtQuerySystemInformation(SystemProcessorPerformanceInformation)` requires an exact-size buffer**: Given 4096 bytes, it returns `STATUS_INFO_LENGTH_MISMATCH`;
  increasing the buffer to the returned length does not help. It must be exactly “logical CPU count × 48 bytes.” Other classes (page files) allow increasing to the returned length. This was why all per-core data was initially empty.
- **The registry ProductName still says “Windows 10” on Windows 11**: They share the NT 10.0 kernel; identify Windows 11 by CurrentBuild ≥ 22000.
- **Google Drive's G: is a fake fixed disk**: `GetDriveType` reports `DRIVE_FIXED`, the filesystem claims FAT32, capacity copies C:, and it even has a volume GUID.
  Only asking for the volume's disk extents (`IOCTL_VOLUME_GET_VOLUME_DISK_EXTENTS`, no administrator privileges needed) reveals it: disk 0, offset 0, length 0. Exclude it using this, not guesses based on the filesystem name.
- **One `net.Interfaces()` call takes about 7 ms** (using `GetAdaptersAddresses` underneath), while reading counters for one adapter (`GetIfEntry2Ex`) takes only tens of microseconds. Cache the adapter list for one minute.
- Determine which adapters count from `MIB_IF_ROW2.InterfaceAndOperStatusFlags`: bit 0 is HardwareInterface, bit 1 is FilterInterface. Tailscale (wintun),
  Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth personal-area networking, and loopback all lack HardwareInterface.

## Orca

- **Orca runtime on Windows uses named pipes**: `transports` in `orca-runtime.json` contains `named-pipe` (`\\.\pipe\orca-<pid>-…`) and `websocket`, but no `unix`.
  `orcart` selects the transport by platform: on Windows, `named-pipe` first (`tailscale/go-winio` for dialing), then `unix`; on other platforms, only `unix`. The protocol (one JSON per line) is unchanged.
- Orca terminals have `ORCA_PANE_KEY` / `ORCA_AGENT_PANE`, just like macOS, plus `ORCA_USER_DATA_PATH` (`%APPDATA%\orca`).
- Paths in the `topologyRevisions` keys of `terminal.list` mix separators (`C:/Users/…` and `C:\Users\…` on the same computer). Do not compare them directly to `worktreePath` as strings.

## herdr

- **herdr's API is a named pipe whose name is the socket path**: herdr uses interprocess's `GenericNamespaced`; `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\herdr\herdr.sock` maps to
  `\\.\pipe\C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\herdr\herdr.sock`. The path itself is not a file, so `os.Stat` on it always reports missing; stat the pipe name instead. The configuration directory is `%APPDATA%\herdr`, not `~/.config/herdr`.
- **`herdr server` started over ssh exits with the ssh session** (Windows OpenSSH ends the entire job when closing a session); `Start-Process` behaves the same way. For a persistent server, use a scheduled task triggered at login, running in the user's desktop session.
- **Panes default to PowerShell**: node's input commands use POSIX shell syntax (`'…'` quotes, `A=1 cmd`), which PowerShell splits incorrectly. Set `[terminal] default_shell` in `config.toml` to Git Bash.
  This key must be under `[terminal]`; at the top level, `reload-config` only reports “unknown config key default_shell; ignoring key.”
- **A fresh Claude Code install first shows the theme-selection onboarding**: node's `waitReady` cannot find the input box within a minute and reports “claude did not become ready,” while the screen shows a theme list. Set `hasCompletedOnboarding: true` in `~/.claude.json`, or run it manually once.
- **apiKeyHelper is executed by cmd on Windows**: `cat ~/.config/…` returns “'cat' 不是内部或外部命令” (“'cat' is not recognized as an internal or external command”); use `type "C:\…\key"`.
- **MinGit does not contain bash.exe** (only `usr\bin\sh.exe`). For Git Bash, use PortableGit or the installed distribution.
- **Quotes are parsed again by cmd when running PowerShell over ssh**: For long scripts, use `powershell -EncodedCommand <UTF-16LE base64>`. PowerShell 5.1 also splits arguments such as `-test.run=A|B` incorrectly when passing them to native programs; wrap them in `cmd /c "…"`.
- **`signal.Ignore(os.Interrupt)` cannot block Ctrl+C**: On Windows, only `signal.Notify` disables the default exit behavior for Ctrl+C / Ctrl+Break (see the os/signal documentation). When `osproc.Exec` used Ignore,
  one Ctrl+C in the console ended the launcher with `0xc000013a`; the child (claude) survived, the parent disappeared, and the exit code was lost. `TestExecSurvivesCtrlC` guards this.
- A test program `xxx.test.exe` can keep running briefly after exit (child processes), making scp fail to overwrite it with `dest open … Failure`. Use another filename or end the process first.
- **Stopping a background shell does not stop the mock hub it started, and a second mock still binds the port**: on Windows, ending the Git Bash job that ran `python3 scripts/mock/mock_hub.py` leaves the Python process running, and Python's `HTTPServer` sets `SO_REUSEADDR`, which on Windows lets a restarted mock bind the same port too. Requests then go to either process, so a fix in the mock seems to have no effect (an unknown `/mock/…` route answers 404). Before restarting, look with `netstat -ano | grep :<port>` and end your own old process by its PID (`taskkill //PID <pid> //F`), never every Python.
