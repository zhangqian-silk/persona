# Configuration (so others can use this repo too)

The repo hard-codes nobody's machines, accounts, domains, or preferences. Everything personal lives in two configs, and code and scripts only read the configs:

| Config | Location | Read by | Covers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Build / deploy config | `~/.config/persona/config.json` on the dev machine (point elsewhere with `PERSONA_CONFIG`), template `config.example.json` at the repo root | `scripts/*` (via `scripts/persona_config.py`), XcodeGen (via the generated `apple/Config.xcconfig`) | The App's bundle id and team, the App Store Connect account, TestFlight testers, which machine / address the hub is on, machines to deploy to, simulators |
| hub runtime config | `~/.persona/hub.json` on the hub machine (0600, contains the token and database password; written by `personad hub setup`, or generated automatically the first time the hub starts; `hub pair`, `hub peer`, `hub manager-code` and `hub assistant-token` only talk to a running hub: they need this file and never create it) | `personad hub` | Listen address, public address, which machines to connect, push timings, whether the hub starts the built-in manager |
| Manager config | `~/.persona/managers/assistant/manager.json` for the built-in manager, `~/.persona/managers/<id>/manager.json` for one made in the app (0600) | the manager (`personad assistant`, `personad manager run`) | Whose assistant it is and what it should know, where it runs by default, the AI gateway and models, the Agents' triage, question delegation and launcher health, the Inbox and its AI twin, the knowledge base, how long hook cards wait; connectors, extensions written by hand, bots, mail sign-ins and the Gmail proxy, Lark and lark-cli, usage sources ("manager.json" below) |

The configs live outside the repo: releases run in a clean worktree (`docs/operations/release.md`), where anything outside the repo would be missing; it also avoids committing them by accident.
`apple/Config.xcconfig` and `CLAUDE.local.md` are in `.gitignore`.

## Naming and configuration

Persona is the only supported spelling. The canonical binary is `personad`, the connector is `persona-link`, runtime state defaults to `~/.persona`, and build/deploy configuration defaults to `~/.config/persona/config.json`. `PERSONA_HOME` and `PERSONA_CONFIG` are the only brand-prefixed overrides. No previous-brand variable, directory, command or URL aliases are read or created.

See [the naming contract](rename.md) and [the approval-gated cutover](persona-cutover.md). Existing installations require explicit, one-time service/config/data/MCP migration before running this version. A source merge does not change live services. Back up and identify the actual storage first; two independent stores must never be merged automatically.

Actual registered bundle / application IDs, App Groups, iCloud containers and keychain access groups come from private configuration and stay unchanged. Naming their carrier variables `PERSONA_*` does not change their values. Other runtime contracts, caches and persisted preferences need the cutover described above. The avatar model remains `persona`: the two bundled choices are Mochi (`persona`) and Milk Frog (`nwverse`); retired choices resolve to Mochi, see [Avatars](../apple/persona.md).

The role-specific root resolver reads only canonical service definitions, including HOME-only environment-file overrides; it does not execute shell configuration or expose credentials. Missing required files fail closed. Queries are read-only, and `--prepare` initializes only the selected root without compatibility links.

## Who owns a setting

One setting has one writer. When two places seem to hold the same thing, this is who wins:

| Layer | Examples | Who writes it | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Build / deploy `config.json` | app ids, App Store, deploy machines, publish | you, once per environment | Scripts only. The hub, manager and node never read it |
| `hub.json` | listen, public/security, database, machines and their per-computer defaults | you / the installer | Hub runtime configuration and **defaults**. Read at hub start |
| `manager.json` | assistant identity, connectors, `agents`, `kb`, `ai`, `inbox`, `usage` | you / the installer | The manager's own configuration and **defaults**. The hub reads none of these sections; a copy left in `hub.json` is stale ([upgrade.md](upgrade.md)) |
| Postgres settings (hub `hub_settings`, manager `settings`) | model configuration, launchers, inbox rules, extension settings, board and triage switches | the apps, the assistant, or a one-time migration | **User preferences. They win over the file defaults** |
| Per-device `devices.prefs` | quiet hours, translation scope, notification switches | that device | Per-device only; not a settings key and not synced as one |
| `PERSONA_*` environment | `DATABASE_URL`, `PUBLIC_URL`, `LISTEN`, `NODE_PACKAGES`, `ADMIN_ACCESS` | the deployment | Overrides the matching `hub.json` field, never written back. Each also accepts its former `JARVIS_*` name |
| Node-local third-party files | Claude / Codex / Antigravity / OMP `settings.json` | the user or those tools | Read by the node on that computer; the Agents settings page edits the allow-listed subset |
| Node-local `node-signing.json` | the certificate a Mac's resident node signs its builds with | you, on that Mac | Read by the resident node at start; never sent to the hub ([mac-node-signing.md](mac-node-signing.md)) |

Consequences worth remembering:

- **The database wins.** A value saved in an app is not written back to `hub.json` or `manager.json`, and editing the file afterwards does not override it. This covers model configuration, launcher and provider settings, inbox rules, per-machine switches such as `botmux` / `herdr_autostart`, and `auto_update_nodes`.
- **Files are defaults, not the current value.** `ai`, `inbox.triage_ai`, `inbox.judge_ai`, `kb.ai`, `assistant.launcher` and `machines[].launchers` are the compatibility baseline the model configuration inherits from, not a second place to change the model (`docs/assistant/model-config.md`).
- **Scope is explicit, not inferred**: per-computer (a machine's own settings), per-manager (Model Settings, Assistant, Knowledge pick one), per-device (notification and translation preferences). A setting that looks the same in two places — the assistant time zone, a device's quiet-hours time zone, the browser's zone — is not one setting.

## Quick start: connecting several machines

An always-on Linux machine runs the hub, and every other computer is connected by the hub over SSH. The other computers need no resident service: when the hub connects it runs
`ssh <host> ~/.persona/bin/personad node --stdio` and speaks the node protocol over SSH's stdin/stdout, reconnecting automatically when it drops (`server/internal/hub/machine.go`).

### Prerequisites

| Machine | Needs |
| --- | --- |
| hub machine (Linux) | docker (the Postgres container; without Docker, use the system's Postgres, see `docs/server/server.md` ("Database")), systemd user services, herdr; the phone must be able to reach the hub: same network, a VPN you set up yourself, or direct public access (IPv6 preferred, with the TLS port open). On a NAS, or when it only serves as a hub without running Agents, it can also run entirely in Docker (`docs/operations/docker.md`); steps 1 and 2 below are then only for installing `personad` on each computer |
| Each computer to connect | Claude Code (or Codex); `~/.persona/bin/personad` and herdr (the deploy script in step 2 copies them over; if herdr is missing, install it into `~/.local/bin` with its official installer, or set `PERSONA_SKIP_HERDR=1` if you use another engine and don't want it) |
| SSH | The hub machine can log in to every computer **without a password** (the hub uses `BatchMode=yes`, so keys only), with an alias for each in the hub machine's `~/.ssh/config`; the dev machine also needs SSH to each one (for deploying) |

For computers behind NAT that the hub can't reach (e.g. a Mac at home, a machine on another private network), use **tailcat** (`docs/server/server.md` ("tailcat hole punching")):
install the resident node on that computer, run `personad node tailcat init` once, and put the printed address into that machine's `tailcat_addr` in hub.json. Neither side needs a public IP,
open ports, or a Tailscale account; the hub tries ssh first and falls back to tailcat. You can also, as before, open a reverse tunnel from that computer to the hub machine
(`ssh -R 2222:localhost:22 <hub machine>`, kept alive with launchd / autossh) and point the alias at `localhost:2222` in the hub machine's `~/.ssh/config`.

### Steps

1. **Dev machine: write the build / deploy config** `~/.config/persona/config.json` (copy from `config.example.json`; fields in the next section).
   The two sections relevant to connecting machines:

   ```json
   "hub": { "machine": "server", "url": "http://server.example.com:18660" },
   "machines": [
     { "id": "server", "ssh": "server", "os": "linux" },
     { "id": "laptop", "ssh": "laptop", "os": "darwin", "hostnames": ["MyMacBook"] }
   ]
   ```

   `ssh` is the host name the **dev machine** uses to SSH to this one. `os` (`linux` / `darwin`) and the optional `arch` (`amd64` / `arm64`) decide which binary to install; when one or both are omitted, the deploy script asks that machine (`uname -s` / `uname -m`), so leaving them out won't install the wrong one (an Intel Mac gets `darwin/amd64`, ARM Linux gets `linux/arm64`). A machine that can't be asked (powered off, unreachable) is skipped as unreachable, not treated as a wrong platform; only a written or reported platform with no matching build is an error, and the whole deploy exits non-zero. `hostnames` are this machine's own host names (`hostname -s`; on macOS the LocalHostName works too); when the deploy script runs on this machine, it copies locally instead of using SSH.
   **Add `hostnames` for whichever machine you run the deploy on**: any machine without them is treated as remote and installed over SSH (if the machine running the deploy lacks them, it SSHes to itself).
   For a computer the dev machine can't reach but another machine (usually the hub machine) can (the key only lives there, no route), write `"via": "<that machine's id>"`:
   the deploy copies to that machine first and installs from there, and `ssh` is then the host name **on that machine**.

2. **Deploy**: `./scripts/deploy/deploy.sh`. It builds `personad` for four platforms (`linux` / `darwin` × `amd64` / `arm64`, same as releases and the Docker image), and each computer gets the one it runs (after installing, it runs `version` once on that machine as a self-check; if that fails it reports an error and doesn't print installed). On the hub machine it
   starts the Postgres container and installs `personad hub` as a systemd user service and starts it.

3. **hub machine: tell the hub which computers to connect**. The first start generates `~/.persona/hub.json` (0600), containing only itself. Add the other computers and the address the phone uses:

   ```json
   "public_url": "http://server.example.com:18660",
   "machines": [
     { "id": "server", "name": "Server", "kind": "local", "icon": "server" },
     { "id": "laptop", "name": "Laptop", "kind": "ssh", "ssh_host": "laptop", "icon": "laptop" }
   ]
   ```

   `ssh_host` is the host name the **hub machine** uses to SSH to this one (each side has its own `~/.ssh/config`, so it can differ from `ssh` in step 1); `id` should match step 1;
   `name` is the name shown in the App; `icon` is `server` / `laptop` / `desktop`. `remote_bin` is the path of `personad` on that computer; when omitted the hub uses `~/.persona/bin/personad` (the canonical binary the deploy script installs); set it if installed elsewhere.
   Whose assistant it is and what it should know (`assistant.owner`, `assistant.notes`) go into the built-in manager's `~/.persona/managers/assistant/manager.json` (make it, 0600, if it isn't there yet; see "manager.json" below). For direct public access add `public.tls_listen` and `public.advertise` and open the TLS port per the [network doc](network.md); keep `public_url` as a reachable private-network address.

4. **Restart the hub so it reads the new config**: `./scripts/deploy/deploy.sh <hub machine id>` (or `systemctl --user restart personad` on the hub machine).

5. **Pair the phone**: run `~/.persona/bin/personad hub pair` on the hub machine and scan the QR code with the App. The command gets a temporary token from the hub running locally; it is valid for 10 minutes, can be redeemed for a device token only once, and after redemption has at most a 2-minute grace period for requests still in the middle of pairing. Only `--legacy` prints the main token.

6. **Check**: in the App, **Settings › Machines** shows every machine online; the "Agents" tab shows the sessions in herdr on each computer. If one is offline, run
   `ssh -o BatchMode=yes <ssh_host> '~/.persona/bin/personad node --stdio'` by hand on the hub machine to see whether SSH fails or the binary is missing.

To add a computer later: add a line to `machines` in both configs and run `./scripts/deploy/deploy.sh <new machine id> <hub machine id>`.

**Recommended: install the node service on the other computers** (2026-11-02, [plan-hub-center.md](../archive/operations/plan-hub-center.md) section 0): install only one hub for the whole household; the other computers skip SSH and
install a resident node plus the connector persona-link, with one command or one App, see [link.md](link.md) ("Install the node service"):

- Linux: `curl -fsSL <site>/install.sh | sh -s -- --node --pair '<link from personad hub pair --machine <id>>'` (this computer connects to the hub; in `machines` it is
  `{"id":"laptop","name":"Laptop","kind":"link","icon":"laptop"}`, and the hub needs `public.tls_listen`), or `… --node --listen` (the hub connects to it;
  paste the printed link into the hub admin UI under **Computers › Add computer › Hub connects**, and in `machines` it is kind `service`).
- Mac: install the independent Persona Link helpers (`./scripts/app/mac-link.sh install`); the connector and resident node run as launchd agents. Pair with the optional desktop setup window or `persona-link pair`.

No `ssh_host`, and no SSH setup on the hub. The SSH setup in steps 1–6 above still works, and is kept only for compatibility from now on.

### Current limitations

- The deploy script only installs the hub on Linux (systemd + docker); the hub can't live on a Mac for now.
- The machine list has to be written in two places: the dev machine's `config.json` covers "where to deploy", the hub's `hub.json` covers "which machines the hub connects".

```

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `app.bundle_id` | The iPhone App's bundle id; the watch is `<id>.watchkitapp`, tests are `<id>.tests`. Written to `PERSONA_BUNDLE_ID` in `apple/Config.xcconfig` |
| `app.team_id` | Developer team, written to `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` in `Config.xcconfig`; the ExportOptions used for export also use it |
| `app.app_group` | The App Group through which the App and the Dynamic Island extension share files (avatar and avatar pack images, `docs/apple/live-activity.md` ("Avatar")), written to `PERSONA_APP_GROUP` in `Config.xcconfig`. Defaults to `group.<app.bundle_id>`; it must be registered on the developer site first (`docs/operations/release.md` ("App Group")) |
| `app.watch_widget_bundle_id` | New watch complication Bundle ID, written to `PERSONA_WATCH_WIDGET_BUNDLE_ID`; defaults to `<app.bundle_id>.watchkitapp.widgets`. This never changes the existing watch app ID. Register it before signed device builds |
| `app.watch_app_group` | New App Group shared only by the watch app and `PersonaWatchWidgets`, written to `PERSONA_WATCH_APP_GROUP`; defaults to `<app.app_group or its derived default>.watch`. It contains watch-only system-surface credentials and caches, never phone credentials. Attach it to both watch targets before device signing |
| `app.push_relay` | Push relay address (e.g. `https://<relay domain>/relay`), written to `PERSONA_PUSH_RELAY` in `Config.xcconfig` and `PersonaPushRelay` in Info.plist: the App registers with it, and hubs without an APNs key push through it (`docs/operations/push-relay.md`). Without it the App doesn't register, and only hubs with `apns.json` can push |
| `app.carplay_voice` | Boolean, default `false`: enabling adds the CarPlay voice-conversation entitlement (`com.apple.developer.carplay-voice-based-conversation`) to signing, making Persona visible in the car. Apply to Apple first and enable it on the App ID after approval; do not enable before approval or signing fails. `scripts/persona_config.py xcconfig` generates `apple/PersonaOptIn.entitlements` and writes `PERSONA_APP_ENTITLEMENTS` (see `docs/apple/carplay.md`) |
| `app.health_background_delivery` | Boolean, default `false`: enabling adds the HealthKit background delivery entitlement (`com.apple.developer.healthkit.background-delivery`) to signing and sets Info.plist `PersonaHealthBackgroundDelivery` (`PERSONA_HEALTH_BACKGROUND_DELIVERY`), so a workout report comes right after the workout is saved to Health, even while Persona is closed. Enable it only after the App ID's provisioning profile allows the entitlement, or signing fails or the export drops it; `scripts/release/entitlements.py check` reports a release without it. Off: reports come when Persona is next opened (see `docs/assistant/health.md`, "Automatic workout reports (iOS)") |
| `app.meta_wearables` | Meta glasses (`docs/apple/meta-glasses.md`): when `enabled` is true, `persona_config.py env` exports `PERSONA_META_WEARABLES=YES`, and only then does xcodegen merge `apple/meta-wearables.yml` (Meta's DAT SDK and the Info.plist keys it needs) into the project; `app_id` and `client_token` are the app's ID and Client Token from the Wearables Developer Center, written to `PERSONA_META_APP_ID` and `PERSONA_META_CLIENT_TOKEN` in `Config.xcconfig`; they can be left empty while the glasses are in Developer Mode (`app_id` 0). Off by default: it needs Xcode 26.4 or later, and carries risk in external TestFlight / App Store review |
| `app.tunnel_core` | Directory containing the in-App tunnel core (`libpersonatunnel.a`, `module.modulemap`, headers; [network.md](network.md) ("Connecting to hub through an in-app tunnel")). Only when set does it write `PERSONA_TUNNEL_INCLUDE` and `PERSONA_TUNNEL_LDFLAGS` into `Config.xcconfig`; only hardware builds link it. Missing files cause `xcconfig` to fail immediately. Omitted means no in-App tunnel |
| `app_store.*` | For `release.sh` / `asc*.py` (`asc_cli.py` hands them to the App Store Connect CLI, `docs/operations/release.md` ("Releasing with asc")): the API key (`key_id`, `issuer_id`, `key_path`), the App record's numeric ID, internal testers, the TestFlight feedback email; `external` is external testing (group name, public link switch and tester limit (`public_link_limit`, 0 means unlimited), privacy policy URL, extra testers invited by email, Beta App Review contact and notes, `docs/operations/release.md`). Env vars such as `ASC_KEY_ID` can still override (key file path `ASC_KEY_PATH` or `ASC_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`) |
| `app_store.provisioning_profiles` | Optional Bundle ID → App Store profile-name map, e.g. `{"com.example.persona": "Existing App Store"}`. Partial overrides preserve defaults for the other targets. `asc_signing.py` and `export-options` share this map. Names must be nonempty; keys must be the app, watch, configured watch widget, Live Activity, notification or share Bundle IDs. Filling in an existing name changes no account resource; do not recreate profiles because of a product rename |
| `hub.machine` | Which machine the hub runs on (an id in `machines`): `deploy.sh` starts Postgres and the systemd service on it, `test-server.sh` runs tests on it, `sim.sh` reads the token from it |
| `hub.url` | The address `sim.sh` uses to pair the simulator; the HTTP in the example is only for a private network / VPN; configure the public entry separately in `public` of `hub.json` |
| `machines[]` | Machines where `deploy.sh` installs `personad`: `ssh` is the ssh host name; `os` (`linux` / `darwin`) and `arch` (`amd64` / `arm64`, optional) decide which binary to install, and whichever is missing is asked from the machine itself (`uname`); `hostnames` are the machine's own host names (when the deploy runs on it, it copies directly without ssh; the machine running the deploy must list them, and any machine without them goes through ssh); `via` is another machine's id: when the dev machine can't reach this one, it ssh-es once more through that machine to transfer the binary (leaving no files there), and `ssh` is then the host name on that machine |
| `simulator` | Default simulator UDID for `sim.sh` (override with `SIM=<udid>`) |
| `publish.site_url` | Where `publish.sh` publishes `personad` and `install.sh` (the domain of the `site/` worker, `docs/operations/release.md` ("Publishing personad")); without it nothing is published |
| `publish.update_url` | Optional: where the `personad` that `publish.sh` and `deploy.sh` build looks for its updates (`-X main.updateURL`): the directory `latest.json` is in, taken as written, so a GitHub repository's release base (`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases/latest/download`) works without `/dl` added. Must be `https://` (or `file:///`), with no user, query or fragment. Without it, `<publish.site_url>/dl`, as before. A hub's `hub.json` `update.url` replaces it at run time (`docs/operations/hub-update.md` ("Update source")) |
| `publish.getting_started_url` | Public page opened by "No hub yet?" on the iOS / Mac welcome screen (the published address of `docs/operations/getting-started.md`), written to Info.plist `PersonaGettingStartedURL`; without it, this row is hidden (#4195) |
| `publish.wrangler` | The wrangler command used to deploy that worker (e.g. a script that wraps authentication); defaults to `npx wrangler` |
| `xcode` | Optional: which Xcode to build and release with (path to the `.app`); `persona_config.py env` exports `DEVELOPER_DIR` from it (a value already in the environment wins). Supporting iPhone Duo needs Xcode 27 or later; Apps built with older versions don't extend under the status bar and camera on Duo |
| `android.application_id` | The Android App's application id (`scripts/app/android.sh`, `docs/android/android.md`); defaults to `app.bundle_id` |
| `android.release_keystore` | Optional: the keystore `scripts/app/android.sh release` signs the release APK with (`~` is expanded). Needs `android.release_key_alias` and `android.release_keystore_password_command`, a shell command that prints the keystore's password; `android.release_key_password_command` prints the key's own password when it differs. Without `android.release_keystore` the command signs with the SDK's local debug keystore, for your own phone only (`docs/android/android.md`, "Build and install") |
| `android.google_oauth_scheme` | The scheme the Android App uses for the Google sign-in callback for Gmail: the reversed client ID of the hub's `google.client_id` (`docs/extensions/mail.md` ("Android")); without it Gmail can only be added with an app-specific password |
| `mac.link_bundle_id` | Bundle-id prefix of the independent Mac Persona Screen helper (`scripts/app/mac-link.sh`, `docs/operations/link.md`); the env var `PERSONA_LINK_BUNDLE_ID` wins; defaults to `app.bundle_id` + `.link` (`PERSONA_BUNDLE_ID` + `.link` when exported), and the build stops when neither is set. macOS keeps Persona Screen's Screen Recording grant per bundle id, so changing it means allowing Screen Recording again on that Mac (#7569) |

`python3 scripts/persona_config.py env` prints shell variables (scripts `eval` it at the top), and `xcconfig` generates `apple/Config.xcconfig`;
`sim.sh` / `release.sh` generate it automatically. Before running `xcodegen` directly or opening Xcode, run `python3 scripts/persona_config.py xcconfig` once.
The committed `project.yml` and `Info.plist` only reference `$(PERSONA_BUNDLE_ID)` / `$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)`, and the keychain service uses the bundle id at runtime.

## Multiple Codex app-server instances

Each machine in `hub.json` can configure `codex_homes` (an array of directories), `codex_servers` (`id`, `name`, `home`, `endpoint`), and optionally `codex_discovery` (automatic discovery by default; false uses only registered sources). For example:

```json
{
  "codex_homes": ["~/.codex-profile"],
  "codex_servers": [
    {"id": "desktop", "name": "Desktop instance", "home": "~/.codex-profile", "endpoint": "unix://<absolute socket path>"}
  ]
}
```

No application name needs hard-coding: every 30 seconds the node discovers the current user's Codex/app-server processes, `CODEX_HOME`, and enabled listen endpoints; existing official control sockets under known homes can also be discovered. Discovered directories and named instances are remembered in the hub's Postgres settings; process/connection generations are not persisted. Private paths belong only in runtime config; do not commit actual config values.

The Unix socket and its immediate parent directory must belong to the current user and be inaccessible to groups/other users; WebSocket runs inside. TCP endpoints allow only literal loopback IPs, disallow external hosts, userinfo, and query credentials, and do not use the system HTTP proxy. Stdio without an endpoint is read-only; no daemon is started, no desktop app replaced, and no file permissions loosened. More limitations in `../integrations/codex-app-server.md`.

## hub runtime config (hub.json)

The sections that are a manager's (whose assistant it is, `ai`, `agents`, `inbox`, `kb`, `hook_timeout_minutes`, connectors, extensions written by hand, bots…) are in its `manager.json` (next section): the hub reads none of them, and says once at start which ones its `hub.json` still has.

```json
{
  "listen": ":18660",
  "public_url": "http://hub.example.com:18660",
  "public": {
    "tls_listen": ":18662",
    "advertise": ["https://hub.example.com:18662"],
    "advertise_ipv6": true,
    "advertise_lan": true
  },
  "security": { "allow_public_plaintext": false, "trusted_cidrs": [] },
  "name": "Home",
  "admin": { "access": "lan" },
  "token": "…",
  "database_url": "…",
  "machines": [
    { "id": "server", "name": "Server", "kind": "local", "icon": "server" },
    { "id": "laptop", "name": "Laptop", "kind": "ssh", "ssh_host": "laptop", "icon": "laptop" }
  ]
}
```

- First run writes only the local machine (`kind: local`, id is the host name); the generated `public_url` is the HTTP address for that host name, only a private-network compatibility endpoint. TLS is off by default; the example explicitly enables `:18662` (an example port, changeable). Configure other machines and domains yourself.
- `listen` is the retained HTTP listener, default `:18660`; `public_url` goes into the QR code's `url` and the candidate list. Existing iOS / Watch clients still need it to point to a reachable private-network / VPN address.
- For each `public` and `security` setting, its defaults, and how to allow traffic, see [network configuration](network.md#hubjson-网络配置). Candidate addresses are sent only after authentication.
- `security.proxy_protocol` (optional, omitted by default): with same-machine port forwarding, a reverse tunnel, or nginx `stream` passthrough in front of the hub, public connections all look like loopback to the hub.
  Set `{"from": ["127.0.0.1/32"]}`: connections from these upstreams must carry a PROXY header (v1 / v2), and the hub checks the real source in the header; `listeners` defaults to only `tls`.
  Syntax, rules, and self-checks in [network.md](network.md#proxy-protocol).
- `name` (optional): the hub's display name (e.g. "Home"), reported by persona-link and shown by clients.
  Defaults to the short host name of the hub machine; if the host name is a Docker container id or `PERSONA_LOCAL_NODE=0`, it uses `hub-<first 6 chars of hub_id>`. Manual file edits require a hub restart;
  edits in the admin UI's "Overview" take effect immediately ([admin.md](admin.md)).
- `initial_locale` (optional, `en` / `zh-Hans` / `ja`): the user language until a device reports one ([i18n.md](../protocol/i18n.md), "User language").
  A new install's `personad hub setup` writes the language the installer ran in (`--lang`, else `PERSONA_INSTALL_LANG`, which `install.sh` sets);
  setup never changes it in an existing file. Once a device has reported a language (Postgres `user_locale`), this field no longer matters;
  omitted or unknown means `zh-Hans`. Edits take effect at the next hub start.
- `admin` (optional): hub admin UI (`<hub address>/admin`, [admin.md](admin.md)). `access` controls who can open it: `loopback` / `lan` (default) / `cidrs` / `any`
  (requires TLS); `cidrs` lists networks allowed with `access: cidrs`; `session_hours` is the login expiry (default 12); `first_setup: "code"` (written by a fresh `personad hub setup` install) requires a setup code even from LAN sources to set the first password; without it only loopback requires one. Access can only be broadened on the hub machine with
  `personad hub admin access <scope>` (or the deploy script); the web UI can only narrow it. Env vars `PERSONA_ADMIN_ACCESS` / `PERSONA_ADMIN_CIDRS` take precedence.
  The admin UI writes hub.json atomically and preserves unknown fields ([admin.md](admin.md) ("Editing hub.json")).
- `mesh` (optional, linked hubs, [mesh.md](../server/mesh.md)): `discovery` (default true: advertise itself with mDNS on the LAN and list discovered hubs; unavailable inside a Docker bridge network),
  `path_switch_seconds` (default 60: when a computer has a better path, it must stay better this long before the primary switches; broken paths switch immediately),
  `plaintext` (off by default: `allow` lists `*`, networks / addresses, `192.0.2.*`, and host names / `*.example.com` used only for dialing that may pair and link without TLS; `advertise` lists `http://` addresses other hubs use to connect to this one in plaintext; no encryption or pinning, see [mesh.md](../server/mesh.md) ("Plaintext links")). Peers, the group's primary, and its term live in
  Postgres, not here. The first version's `takeover_seconds` is no longer used.
- `link` (optional, computer-link heartbeat, [link.md](link.md) ("Heartbeat")): `ping_seconds` (ping interval, default 10), `ping_timeout_seconds` (time without pong before disconnecting, default 5).
  Omitted or 0 uses the default; setting only one leaves the other at its default. Range 1–600 seconds, capped at 600. Controls the hub's pings on Persona Link connections and streams, and the manager's pings on connector (kind service) streams.
  When set, the manager also tells Persona Link (in `endpoints` for active mode, in stream-opening request headers for passive mode), and the computer pings accordingly; hub-to-hub links are unaffected and remain 10 seconds / 5 seconds.
  On slow links (only tens of KB/s between hub and computer), pings queue behind data being written (a 1 MiB chunk at 30 KB/s takes over 30 seconds); a timeout shorter than writing one chunk always causes a false disconnect. Set
  `ping_timeout_seconds` longer (e.g. `{"ping_seconds": 30, "ping_timeout_seconds": 90}`); a dead link then takes roughly "interval + timeout" to detect. The network library's ping send and pong reply
  themselves wait at most 5 seconds, and forwarding a message writes for at most 1 minute; neither is configurable (link.md ("Heartbeat")).
  Older Persona Link versions do not recognize these settings and still ping at their own 10 seconds / 5 seconds (active mode only pings the connection itself; passive mode also pings every stream); upgrade both together. Manual file edits require a hub restart.
- `machines`: since 2026-11-04 these are defaults handed by the hub to the manager (the assistant process) at handshake, and **the manager connects them** ([machines.md](../server/machines.md) ("Who connects to computers")). Where the text below says "the hub dials" or "the hub connects",
  the manager actually dials (on the hub machine it is the hub's child process using the same HOME: ssh config and its keys in `~/.persona/managers/assistant/` are all this machine's). Computers added in the admin UI at runtime are also handed to it and connected immediately.
- `machines[].kind`: `local` (the hub's own machine), `service` (the hub dials this connector's passive port, "Hub connects", see the next item), `link` (this machine's persona-link
  actively connects to the hub, "Computer connects", [link.md](link.md)); `ssh` (the hub connects via `ssh_host`) and `tailcat` (tailcat only, see the item after next) are retained only for existing configs,
  no longer added through the admin UI; migration steps in [mesh.md](../server/mesh.md) ("SSH / tailcat: compatibility"). One computer may have several entries (e.g. a service and a link); the hub recognizes
  the same computer by machine_uid, lists it once, and uses the best path ([mesh.md](../server/mesh.md) ("Multiple paths to one computer")).
- `machines[].trust` (optional): `"work"` prevents that computer from reading personal data through the manager. Omitted or `"personal"` keeps the existing access; other values are rejected when loading hub.json.
  Work computers cannot list or execute phone tools, connector tools (including mail), or assistant tools, and cannot read the assistant's live context or model configuration. `personad notify`, `personad ask`, and Agent question / approval cards still work; personal computers and the assistant can continue driving Agents on work computers.
  This policy applies to every path to the same physical computer: a `work` entry also restricts its aliases. The assistant's default placement skips work computers, and `manager.json` cannot set `assistant.machine` to one. A bad explicit placement rejects the manager's handshake; a bad edit while connected is logged and keeps the last valid settings. With no eligible computer, no assistant is placed. The app's assistant-machine setting has the same restriction.
  Tasks sent to a work computer do not receive automatic knowledge-base project background, and the Inbox AI twin cannot run there. Set the field in **hub.json**, then restart the hub to apply it; this field is separate from pairing approval (`machine_trust`).
- `machines[].address`, `machines[].proxy` (kind `service`): the connector's `host:port` (included in the link from `persona-link pair --listen`; paste it under **Add computer ›
  Hub connects** in the admin UI to fill it in); optional `proxy`, `socks5://[user:password@]host:port`, lets the hub connect through this SOCKS proxy (when the computer is only reachable through another machine).
  The connector's public-key fingerprint and the credentials the hub gives it are not in hub.json: pairing stores them in Postgres (credentials encrypted with `~/.persona/secret.key`).
- `machines[].tailcat_addr` (optional): the `tc…` address printed by `personad node tailcat init` on that computer; the hub connects through tailcat when ssh fails
  (`docs/server/server.md` ("tailcat hole punching")). The address is a secret (includes the WireGuard preshared key); keep it only in hub.json, like the token. `kind: "tailcat"` means
  tailcat only, no ssh attempt (no `ssh_host`); `kind: "ssh"` plus `tailcat_addr` means ssh first, tailcat on failure.
- Env vars `PERSONA_DATABASE_URL`, `PERSONA_PUBLIC_URL`, `PERSONA_LISTEN`, `PERSONA_NODE_PACKAGES`, `PERSONA_ADMIN_ACCESS` override the corresponding settings (new `PERSONA_*` names win, not written back to the file); Docker deployments use them. A nonempty `PERSONA_ADMIN_ACCESS` replaces the whole `admin` access scope together with `PERSONA_ADMIN_CIDRS`; setting only `PERSONA_ADMIN_CIDRS` has no effect
  (`docs/operations/docker.md` ("Environment variables")); with `PERSONA_LOCAL_NODE=0`, first run does not write the local machine.
- `node_packages` (optional): where the manager fetches the node builds the hub has none of its own for (a computer of another OS or architecture, persona-node: `docs/operations/node-update.md` ("Node packages")). `url` is a release's `dl/` (`https://<site>/dl`, or a mirror of it that serves `latest.json` and `<version>/manifest.json` with the archives beside them); empty uses the hub's update source (`update.url`, else this build's update URL: a release hub's; a Docker image built with one), through `update.proxy` unless `proxy` here names one; `"off"` never fetches. A mirror must answer 404 for a file it does not have (any other error counts as the site being away). `proxy` is an `http://[user:pass@]host:port` proxy for it (the environment's proxies are not used). The env var `PERSONA_NODE_PACKAGES` overrides `url` (a compose file's mirror, or `off`); `docs/operations/docker.md` ("Node builds") covers hubs without internet access.
- `update` (optional): where the hub looks for its own releases and the Android app they carry, and how it reaches them (`docs/operations/hub-update.md` ("Update source"); the Android app: `docs/operations/hub-update.md` ("The Android app")). `url` is the directory `latest.json` is in (`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases/latest/download`, a publish site's `https://<site>/dl`, or a mirror), in place of the one the build was made with; empty keeps the build's. It must be `https://` (`http://` only to this machine: releases are not signed), or `file:///<directory>`, without a user, password, query or fragment; one that does not read leaves the hub with no source, and Settings › hub says why. `proxy` is an `http://[user:pass@]host:port` proxy for the update's checks and downloads alone (and for node builds fetched from the same source, below); everything else the hub talks to goes as before. A `proxy` that does not read fails every check rather than going around it. Empty uses the environment's proxies for these requests, as before. Its user and password never appear in the log or the app. Read at the hub's start.
- `tailcat.derp_map_url` (optional): the DERP map URL when using a self-hosted DERP relay (derper, see `docs/server/server.md` ("Self-hosted relay")) instead of Tailscale's public relays; each computer's
  `init` must use the same `--derp-map-url`.
- `machines[].claude_config_dirs` (optional): Claude Code config directories on this machine besides `~/.claude` (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` set by launchers,
  e.g. `["~/.config/claude-code/profiles/work"]`; `~/` is that machine's home). The node finds directories used by running claude processes itself and remembers them in the database;
  only list directories "not usually running, but whose historical sessions you want in the list" here. Conversely, hide unwanted directories (automation scripts' own `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`)
  in **Settings › Claude Code › Blocked Config Folders** in the App; stored in the database, not hub.json (`docs/integrations/claude-integration.md` ("Blocking configuration directories")).
- `machines[].claude_start_dir` (optional): the `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` passed when Persona starts an Agent with the `claude` launcher on this machine
  (new Agent, to-do dispatch, assistant's agent_start, assistant chats), e.g. `"~/.config/claude-code/profiles/work"` (`~/` is that machine's home). For computers where "claude is signed into a profile directory, not `~/.claude`":
  without it, Persona's claude uses the default directory, which is not logged in and immediately replies `Not logged in · Please run /login` (#1459). Only controls the `claude` launcher;
  aliases / functions in `~/.zshrc` and Persona-managed launchers keep their own settings. This directory is also added automatically to the session-search directories above. The node must also be this version; manual hub.json edits require a hub restart and take effect on reconnect.
- `machines[].inbox_dir` (optional): this computer's **receive folder**, where files sent to it to keep land (from the phone with `dest=inbox`, and from another computer through `POST /api/v1/files/transfer`), e.g. `"~/Inbox"` (`~/` is that machine's home) or an absolute folder in the home.
  Omitted means `~/Downloads/Persona`. The node makes it when missing and refuses a folder the phone may not write to (outside the home, `~/.persona`, `~/Library`, key folders, links out of the home: 409 `read_only`), so a typo never creates a folder elsewhere ([file-transfer.md](../protocol/file-transfer.md)). Manual hub.json edits require a hub restart.
- `machines[].botmux` (optional): false means this computer's node neither lists botmux sessions nor runs botmux (no `botmux observe`, `botmux dashboard current`);
  omitted means the old behavior, listing sessions if botmux is installed (`docs/integrations/engines.md` ("botmux")). The node must also be this version; manual hub.json edits require a hub restart and take effect on reconnect.
  It is now only a default: "Also Show botmux Sessions" in machine details (the web in the page header, iOS under "Engine") is stored per machine in settings (`botmux/<machine id>`) and wins once set (#2575).
- `machines[].herdr_autostart` (optional): false means this computer's node does not start herdr's server itself when herdr is not running; omitted means on
  (`docs/integrations/engines.md` ("When herdr is not running")). **Only a default**: once the user chooses per machine under **Settings › Machines › Engine**, that choice wins
  (stored in the hub's settings, `herdr_autostart/<machine id>`); later edits here do not affect machines already configured.
- `machines[].herdr_autoinstall` (optional, off by default): true means when herdr is missing on this computer, the node installs a pinned version before starting herdr itself
  (at startup, before creating / continuing sessions). Without it, installation happens only when the user taps "Start" in the Agents list (`docs/integrations/engines.md` ("When herdr is not installed")). The node must also be this version; manual hub.json edits require a hub restart and take effect on reconnect.
- `machines[].claude_global_hooks` (optional, off by default): true means this computer's node adds **report-only** hooks to `settings.json` in the default Claude config directory (asynchronous, short timeout, never answer approvals),
  so sessions not started by Persona also report turns and question events to Persona; false or removing the key removes Persona's entries on the next connection (if none exist, nothing is written).
  No blocking hooks are added: users' global configs often have other tools' synchronous PermissionRequest hooks; stacking them delays terminal dialogs (`docs/integrations/claude-integration.md` ("Global report-only hooks")).
  The node must also be this version; manual hub.json edits require a hub restart and take effect on reconnect.
- `machines[].usage_windows` (optional, on by default): false means this computer's node does not read Codex / Claude subscription usage windows (no `rate_limits` in rollouts,
  no `~/.persona/usage/claude*.json`), and the manager does not ask it either. Omitted means read, local files only, no login credentials touched, every 5 minutes (`docs/server/usage-windows.md`).
  The node must also be this version; manual hub.json edits require a hub restart and take effect on reconnect.
- `machines[].launchers` (optional): add launchers the node cannot list on this computer (e.g. shell wrapper functions), or override `agent_type`, `base_url`, `model` for same-name launchers the node reports (omitted fields stay unchanged),
  e.g. `[{"name":"example_wrapper","agent_type":"codex"}]`: the wrapper actually runs Codex (`agent_type` is `claude` / `codex` / `traex` or a runtime's agent; `docs/protocol/protocol.md`, `docs/assistant/model-config.md`).
- `personas.github_login` (optional): whose level on the NWVERSE board determines the tiered avatar (Milk Frog). Defaults to the GitHub connector's logged-in account;
  with neither, shows the default "Unhatched" tier (`docs/apple/persona.md` ("Tiered avatars")).
- `assistant.mode` (default `child`): `child`, the hub starts the built-in manager as its child (below); `service`, the built-in manager is a service of its own, bound once with a one-time code, and the hub neither starts it nor gives it a token (`persona-hub manager-mode`, [managers.md](../assistant/managers.md) ("The built-in manager as its own service")). `hub setup` writes `service` into a new install's `hub.json` when it installs services, and installs and binds that service; `hub setup --manager-service` switches an existing hub. A value this version does not know (a later version's, a typo) starts no built-in manager, and the hub says so in its log. Taken at the hub's start.
- `assistant.external` (default `false`): the assistant process (`personad assistant`, `docs/assistant/assistant.md` ("Process")) is started externally. By default the hub starts it as a child process and restarts it on exit,
  giving it a fresh bus token at every start (via stdin); with `true` the hub does not start it. On the machine that will run it, first generate a token with `personad hub assistant-token` (printed once; generating again replaces the old one), then
  `PERSONA_ASSISTANT_TOKEN=<token> PERSONA_ASSISTANT_HUB=<hub address> personad assistant`. It reads hub.json and env vars just like the hub: database from `database_url` (`PERSONA_DATABASE_URL` takes priority);
  its own sections come from the `manager.json` on that machine (`~/.persona/managers/assistant/manager.json`, moved once from the hub.json there, "manager.json" below); without `PERSONA_ASSISTANT_HUB`, it connects to the local `listen` port. While the assistant is disconnected, its APIs return `503 assistant_offline`.
  An `https` hub with its own self-signed certificate (the public TLS port, [network.md](network.md)) also needs `PERSONA_ASSISTANT_FINGERPRINT=<fp>`: the public-key fingerprint `personad hub pair` prints, which it pins as a manager on another computer does (#1255).
  Without it the system's CAs are checked (a hub behind a reverse proxy with a public certificate); a value that is not a fingerprint, or one set for an `http` hub, stops it at start.
  The assistant also carries all computers ([machines.md](../server/machines.md) ("Who connects to computers")): when running elsewhere, that machine connects the computers in `machines` (ssh host names, tailcat key,
  and even the hub machine's own `node --stdio` are on that machine); while disconnected, machines show offline and machine APIs return `503 assistant_offline`.
  Other managers created in the App do not read this hub.json section: their configuration is `manager.json` in their own directory ([managers.md](../assistant/managers.md) ("A second manager")); their database is a Postgres of their own (a Docker container `personad manager install` makes, or `--database-url`), never the hub's.
  This key stays in hub.json: the hub decides whether to start the built-in manager, before any manager is connected.
- `assistant.persona_view` / `assistant.html_views`: no longer read (#5509). The assistant's cards, HTML ones included, are always on: replies use ```` ```persona-view ```` and HTML components may call `persona.reply` / `persona.open`, each client running HTML only once it passed its own security acceptance and showing fallback otherwise (`docs/assistant/assistant-views.md` ("Prompts")).
  A hub.json that still has either key works as before; the hub logs at start that they are ignored, and they can be removed.
- `notify`: timing for "Done" pushes (`hub/notify.go`, omitted uses defaults): `done_delay_seconds` (how long after completion to wait for someone to look before pushing, default 60),
  `long_turn_seconds` (how long a round must be to count as a "long task", default 60), `background_hold_minutes` (maximum wait for background tasks to finish, default 120),
  `live_metrics_seconds` (minimum interval between pushes to one device when only Live Activity numbers change, default 60; `docs/apple/live-activity.md` ("Push budget")).
  Each device's push preferences are set separately in the App (**Settings › Notifications**, stored in hub `devices.prefs`), not here.
  This section stays in hub.json: push delivery is the hub's, and it hands the timings to the managers in its hello.
- `screen_link_off` (default `false`): the hub never selects the live screen's session subprotocol, so every live screen stays on the
  plain relay through the hub, whatever the apps and nodes support ([computer-use.md](../extensions/computer-use.md) ("Live screen routes (#6398)")).
  The switch for when direct routes misbehave; it takes effect when the hub restarts.
- `intercept_readers` (default empty): extension IDs whose tokens may read `GET /api/v1/push/intercepts`, on top of the
  `notify` scope. Full credentials always may; an extension token whose ID is not listed gets 403 even with `notify`.
  A listed extension still reads only its own manager's entries, and held-push bodies are stored and served as a
  summary (title plus at most 140 runes), never as full text. Add the extension's ID (its manifest `name`) here when
  its control panel needs the held-push list; it takes effect when the hub restarts.
- `shutdown_timeout_seconds` (default 8): total hub shutdown budget, including closing the database connection pool; external `docker stop -t` must be longer (`docs/server/server.md` ("Shutdown")).
- `auto_update_nodes` (default `false`): lets the managers update the computers' nodes by themselves, after a confirmed hub update and when a node on another build reconnects (the hub hands it over in `devices.config`).
  Off, a node changes only when someone picks **Redeploy** for its computer ([hub-update.md](hub-update.md) ("Node upgrade policy")).

## manager.json

A manager's own sections of the configuration are in its `manager.json`, not in `hub.json`: the hub reads none of them (`server/internal/managerconf`). When its `hub.json` still has some (from before they moved), the hub says once at start which: an edit there does nothing.

- The built-in manager (the assistant process the hub starts, `personad assistant`): `~/.persona/managers/assistant/manager.json` (0600, its directory 0700), where its own directory goes once it is a service of its own. It holds no identity: the hub hands this manager its token.
- A manager made in the app: the `manager.json` of its own directory (`~/.persona/managers/<id>/manager.json`), next to who it is (`id`, `hub`, `token`…; [managers.md](../assistant/managers.md) ("Directory and manager.json")).
- **The move out of `hub.json`, and switching to an older build**: these sections were copied into `manager.json` once; nothing reads `hub.json`'s copies any more, and an edit there after the move is stale and said so at start. The move itself, the backup copies, and what to check before running an older build are in [upgrade.md](upgrade.md) ("hub.json → manager.json").
- **Its computers** (`machines`, `machines_from_hub`): the entries the manager connects, as the hub last handed them over, kept so that a manager whose hub hasn't answered within 20 seconds of its start connects them ([managers.md](../assistant/managers.md) ("Each manager's computers")). The hub still edits the lists for now (adding, removing and moving a computer go through `hub.json` and the admin page), and each hand-over is written over `machines`: an edit there by hand lasts only until the hub's next one.
- **The hub's hello**: the hub no longer hands these sections over in its answer to `manager.hello`; the manager lays its `manager.json` over that answer. What the answer still carries is the hub's: the machines this manager owns and a default machine among them, the launchers `hub.json`'s `machines[].launchers` add for them, `persona_view` / `html_views` (always true, for a manager from before #5509), the push timings, the user's language and the mutes (`docs/protocol/protocol.md` ("Handshake")). A manager from before this change gets no owner, notes, Agents, knowledge base or model defaults from the hub any more and runs on its built-in ones ([managers.md](../assistant/managers.md) ("Configuration")).
- The built-in manager's own files are in its directory beside its `manager.json`: `secret.key`, `tailcat-hub.json` and `handles.key`, copied there once from `~/.persona` (`moved_from_data_dir`); its `secret.key` is rotated to a key of its own once its data is in its own database ([managers.md](../assistant/managers.md) ("Its own secret.key")). Its knowledge base stays at `~/.persona/data` unless `kb_dir` says where ([managers.md](../assistant/managers.md) ("The built-in manager's own files")).
- Edits: the admin UI's **Usage sources** writes `manager.json`'s `usage`; hand edits of `manager.json` take effect when the hub restarts (which restarts the built-in manager), or the manager for one made in the app. The sections the hub's hello used to carry (`assistant`'s four keys, `agents`, `kb`, `ai`, `inbox`'s models and `inbox.agent.machine`, `hook_timeout_minutes`) are also read again whenever the hello arrives (a reconnect, a `manager.updated`). What is changed in the app (About me, the assistant's machine and launcher, the triage switches, model configuration) is stored in the database and wins over these defaults.
- A `lark` section that fails its own check (an account out of range, an unknown `prefer`) no longer stops the hub: the manager says so at start and doesn't use it (lark-cli is then off for the assistant).
- **A `manager.json` that doesn't read stops the manager, not the hub**: when it isn't JSON or is empty, a section the manager reads at start (every moved one but `usage`, the hello's `assistant`, `agents`, `kb`, `ai`, `inbox` and `hook_timeout_minutes` included: a `usage` of the wrong shape is said in the log and no usage source runs) has the wrong shape, a `connector_gate` rule is one the gate can't use, its `moved_from_hub_json` is broken, it, its directory or the `hub.json` beside it is a link to nothing (a volume not mounted yet), that `hub.json` doesn't read, or the move can't be written, the manager doesn't start and says why (naming the file). A `lark_gate` rule's action is not checked: one the gate doesn't know asks for confirmation. Started without its sections it would drop the user's gate rules (`lark_gate`, `connector_gate`), and the computers would fall back to their own, which let every read through. The hub keeps running and starts the built-in manager again with its usual backoff (1 s doubling to a minute), saying the reason each time until the file is fixed; the app shows that manager as offline meanwhile. A manager made in the app does the same each time its service starts it again (every few seconds): its own Postgres container, when install made one, is started first, and the check runs before the manager connects to its database or starts any work; a `manager.json` that isn't JSON, is empty or isn't there at all (a link to a volume not mounted yet) is the exception: as before, a manager made in the app exits with status 2 on it, which its systemd service doesn't restart on (launchd and Docker do), so on Linux start it again once the file is back.
  While a manager runs, a `manager.json` that stops reading (a hand edit gone wrong) doesn't take effect: it keeps the sections it last read and says so in its log, rather than falling back to defaults, until the file is fixed (its next start fails as above).

```

- `assistant.owner`: how the assistant in the "Chat" tab addresses you; `assistant.notes`: Markdown appended to the assistant instructions (`~/.persona/assistant/CLAUDE.md`),
  describing things specific to your environment: code locations, skills / CLIs for work data, directories it must not touch.
- `assistant.machine` / `assistant.launcher`: default machine and launcher for the assistant (unset, or a machine the hub doesn't have: the hub's own machine, else the first one; `claude`); App settings take priority once changed.
  `owner`, `notes`, `machine`, `launcher` are all defaults, laid over the hub's hello: changed settings belong to the assistant itself (settings `assistant`, only it reads/writes them, `docs/assistant/assistant.md` ("Boundary with hub")).
  Only these four keys of `assistant` are the manager's: `external` stays in hub.json ("hub runtime config" above).
- The everyday entry for model settings is **Settings › Model Providers / Model Configuration** (`docs/assistant/model-config.md`): the former manages connections and credentials; the latter manages uses such as chat, classification, translation, knowledge processing, `/agent`, and scheduled tasks. Old `ai`, `inbox.*_ai`, `kb.ai` (here) and launcher defaults (`assistant.launcher` here, `machines[].launchers` in hub.json) remain as a compatibility baseline; unified-use overrides live in Postgres, not written back to either file. Without an override the original model is kept; opening settings does not migrate it to another provider.
- `ai` (no default since 2026-10-31): model for small App features calling model APIs directly (not through Claude Code): Inbox triage, drafting replies, recognizing email config from pasted text.
  When omitted, these uses automatically select a directly callable connection on the hub (with a Key in **Settings › Model Providers**, see `docs/assistant/model-config.md` ("Editing and inheritance")); only if none exist do they report "No directly callable model yet".
  `api` is `messages` (Anthropic Messages, default) or `responses` (OpenAI Responses, always streamed, compatible with relays accepting only `stream: true`);
  `base_url` gets `/v1/messages` or `/v1/responses` appended; `api_key_file` is the key file on the manager's machine (the hub machine for the built-in manager; 0600, read only at call time); `model`;
  `reasoning_effort` applies to `responses` and `messages` (e.g. `low`): `off` maps to Responses `none` and the model's supported Messages no-thinking mode, or low effort on Messages models that cannot disable thinking; `bearer` (default `false`) true sends the Messages API key as `Authorization: Bearer` instead of `x-api-key`, for gateways accepting only Bearer (`responses` always uses Bearer).
- `inbox.triage_ai` / `inbox.judge_ai` (optional, same fields as `ai`, omitted fields inherit from `ai`): AI twin model 1 (triage) and model 2 (linking a Needs you item to one of the user's tasks);
  omitted means both use `ai`. `inbox.agent`: model 3, `enabled`, `launcher` (Claude Code launcher, default the assistant's), `machine` (default the assistant's machine),
  `concurrency` (1), `timeout_minutes` (15), `max_age_hours` (24), `rules` (no longer read; what the twin takes on is set by inbox policies, `docs/assistant/inbox.md` ("Policies")). See `docs/assistant/inbox.md` ("AI twin: handling chats and suggestions").

  ```json
  "inbox": {
    "triage_ai": { "base_url": "<gateway address>", "api_key_file": "~/.persona/inbox-ai.key", "model": "<model>" },
    "judge_ai":  { "base_url": "<gateway address>", "api_key_file": "~/.persona/inbox-ai.key", "model": "<model>" },
    "agent": { "enabled": true, "launcher": "<launcher>" }
  }
  ```
- `inbox.rules`: personal rules for Inbox AI triage (natural language, e.g. "anything from this person needs me", "this alert group is only noise"), appended to the triage prompt and preferred over default judgments (`docs/assistant/inbox.md`).
  When a connector item carries its own rules (`rules`, e.g. an extension's `triage_rules` setting), those are used instead of this setting.
- `kb`: knowledge base (`docs/assistant/knowledge.md`): `enabled` (on by default), `read_only` (off by default), `text_days` (text retention days, 365), `attachment_days` (attachments, 30),
  `attachment_days_by_source` (attachment days for one source's chats, e.g. `{"<source>": 3650}` with `"text_days": 3650` for a chat source whose history is imported with its images; sources not listed and values of 0 or less keep `attachment_days`;
  used both when deciding whether to download an attachment and when cleanup deletes attachment days). `attachment_days` and `attachment_days_by_source` are both capped at `text_days`,
  since an attachment goes with its line: with `text_days` 365, a source set to 3650 keeps 365 days of attachments,
  `history` (importing chats' older history, **off unless `enabled` is `true`**; `docs/assistant/knowledge.md` "History import"):
  `{"enabled": true, "sources": {"<connector id>": {"profile": "careful", "needs_search_index": true}}}`. Sources run one at a time in the order written, and only after
  the owner approves each source's plan in the assistant chat. Per source: `profile` (`careful`, the default, or `standard`), `needs_search_index` (default `true`: wait until
  the knowledge base has built its search index, which the manager does by itself within its first minutes on an existing archive, #1273; `false` does not wait), `page_limit` (page size asked for, a hint, 50) and pace overrides, each `[least, most]` or one number:
  `interval_seconds`, `batch_calls`, `rest_minutes`, `long_rest_every_hours` and `long_rest_minutes` (`[0, 0]`: none), `quiet_periods_per_day` and `quiet_hours`,
  `switch_chat_pages`, `image_interval_seconds`, and `slow_factor` (≥ 1: every interval and rest multiplied by it, e.g. `2` after a stop the import caused). A range that
  does not read (most below least, a negative number or bound) or a negative `slow_factor` is an error in `manager.json` like any other (a running manager keeps what it last read). Changing `kb.history`
  never reopens the knowledge base: the import reads it again before every call, so `enabled: false` stops it before its next call.
  `kb.history` keeps only the switch and the pacing: which chats are read, how much of each and how far back (`history.<source>.back_days`) are the knowledge base's
  selection, which the manager keeps in its settings table, not here,
  `ai` (model for compression and tagging, same fields as `ai`; defaults to `inbox.triage_ai`, then `ai`), `extra_dirs` (note directories you maintain on the manager's machine, the hub machine for the built-in manager,
  e.g. a git repo of facts / lessons: `kb_search` also searches Markdown in these directories (read-only, skips dot directories such as `.git`), and the assistant's CLAUDE.md mentions them; `~/` is that machine's home).
  With `enabled: true, read_only: true`, the manager serves existing local archives without collection, model calls,
  retention, opening-time maintenance or knowledge writes (including edits, extension updates and recording uploads/deletions).
  A missing archive returns empty lists without creating files. Recording sync writes return `403 kb_read_only`, never a deletion acknowledgement.
  Archives containing symbolic links, non-regular files, unreadable files or malformed entity metadata are unavailable rather than reported as empty.
  `enabled: false` still disables reads. Restart the manager to enter read-only mode so no earlier automatic round remains in flight.
- **Selection** (what the knowledge base brings in from chats and documents and for how many days, daily ingestion and the history import alike;
  `docs/assistant/knowledge.md` "Selection"): not in `manager.json` but in the manager's settings table (key `kb.selection`), edited through
  `GET` / `PUT /api/v1/kb/selection` (the whole document, validated; a read-only device gets 403) and `GET /api/v1/kb/selection/candidates?source=<connector id>`
  (a source's chats, for a per-item picker), or per chat with `kb_history_plan`; an app settings page is a follow-up. No document saved means the defaults: mentions of you, your own messages with 50 on each side, and direct messages,
  every rule's `days` null (`kb.text_days`) and attachments as `attachment_days` / `attachment_days_by_source` say. Turning a rule off only stops writing new lines;
  what is stored is pruned by days alone, and shorter days apply only once you set them. Documents (`docs` rules, per-item `doc` settings) had no retention
  before the selection, so a document is deleted only once you set days for its rule or for it; with the defaults none is.
  The knowledge base belongs to the manager, which reads the whole section here (`ai` included: it is the default of its `kb.*` model purposes);
  an assistant run elsewhere (`assistant.external`) reads the `manager.json` on its own machine, and its `extra_dirs` are paths there (`docs/assistant/knowledge.md` ("Who owns what")).
- `agents.triage`: triage after a round stops ([agent-work.md](../assistant/agent-work.md) ("Switches")). Switches are under **Settings › Session Triage** in the App (stored in the manager's settings, all off by default but `transient_retry`),
  and only limits live here: `max_retries` (maximum consecutive automatic continuations after transient errors, default 5), `retry_base_seconds` (the first continuation's backoff, doubled for each next one, default 15), `max_wakes` (maximum wakes, default 6), `settle_seconds` (delay after stopping before triage, default 15);
  `enabled` / `auto_continue` / `wake` / `decide` / `tool_loop` / `closeout` / `closeout_ask` / `transient_retry` are merely initial values if never saved in the App (omitted means off, but `transient_retry` on). Triage is done by the manager (assistant process), which reads this section here; for hand edits see **Edits** above.
- `agents.launcher_health`: launcher health checks and automatic repair ([launcher-health.md](../server/launcher-health.md)): `enabled` (off by default; true enables periodic checks and automatic repair), `interval_minutes` (default 30),
  `repair` (repair Agent: no `skill` means no repair Agent, only CLI upgrades; `machine` defaults to the assistant's computer, `cwd` to home, `launcher` to an available one, `permission` is the permission mode, default `bypassPermissions`).
- `agents.delegate` (#3029): the assistant answers Agent questions first ([assistant.md](../assistant/assistant.md) ("Assistant answers questions first")). **Off by default**, enabled only with `enabled: true`;
  `timeout_seconds` is how long the assistant may take (default 180); if no result arrives, the question is pushed to the user unchanged. `rules` are the user's own delegation rules (prose shown to the model with built-in rules; they cannot relax red lines).
  For hand edits see **Edits** above. Example enabling it (alongside the other sections of `manager.json`):

  ```json
  "agents": {
    "delegate": {
      "enabled": true,
      "timeout_seconds": 180,
      "rules": "If tests are missing, add them without asking me"
    }
  }
  ```

  Model selection is elsewhere: **Settings › Model Configuration › Question Delegation** (purpose `agent.delegate`). If never selected, it uses the "Information Filtering" connection with Opus 5.5 (`claude-opus-5-5`);
  change provider or model there, or use `PATCH /api/v1/model-config/purposes/agent.delegate` (`{"revision": <current>, "model": "claude-sonnet-5-5"}`); "Restore Defaults" returns to Opus.
- `agents.dispatch` (#3253): an Agent hands a subtask to a new Agent on another connected computer and reads the result back ([plan-agent-dispatch.md](../plans/plan-agent-dispatch.md)). **Off by default.**
  `enabled` (true lists the Agents' `dispatch_start` / `dispatch_read` tools; a dispatched task runs on the target computer's default launcher and model for new Agents, started by an Agent and not by you),
  `max_active` (how many of one Agent's dispatched tasks may be working at a time, default 3). Work computers and guest conversations never get the tools. Restart the hub after changing it. Example:

  ```json
  "agents": {
    "dispatch": { "enabled": true }
  }
  ```

- `agents.review` (#2173): the independent review of a supervised task's finished change ([unified-entry.md](../assistant/unified-entry.md) ("Independent review")). **Off by default**, on once `launcher` names a launcher on the working agent's computer (pick one on another model than your agents'; there is no default reviewer).
  `model` and `effort` (optional) override the launcher's own; `permission` is the reviewer's permission mode (default `plan`); `timeout_minutes` bounds one review (default 30). The reviewer works in a disposable copy of the change, so its permission mode is a second guard, not the only one. Example:

  ```json
  "agents": {
    "review": { "launcher": "<launcher name>", "model": "<model id>" }
  }
  ```

- `hook_timeout_minutes` (default 30, 0 or negative also means 30): maximum time Claude Code hooks wait for phone answers (questions, approvals); timeout hands control back to the terminal (`docs/integrations/claude-integration.md`).
- `usage` (optional): subscription usage sources from an account-pool gateway (such as a relay), merged into the sidebar's usage bar (`docs/server/usage-windows.md` ("Account-pool gateways"), #2595).
  `usage.sources[]` (at most 8): `id`, `name` (source name in the sidebar), `type` (`relay` / `generic`; old type names are still read as `relay` and rewritten to the new name the next time this source is edited in the admin UI), `url`, `key` (the gateway's admin Key, **a secret: only in `manager.json` (0600)**, unreadable from the admin UI and APIs, absent from logs), `enabled` (false disables this source).
  `usage.enabled` (false is the master switch), `usage.poll_minutes` (poll interval per source, default 5, 1 to 1440). This section belongs to **the manager** (`personad assistant`, which reads and writes it in its `manager.json`; the hub does not read it): it only reads the gateway's cached numbers (`refresh=false`), requests come from the manager, and nodes never touch the gateway.
  Edit in the admin UI at `/admin/usage` (the hub forwards to the manager) for immediate effect; manual edits require a hub restart (which restarts the manager too), or opening this admin page (the manager adopts the version on disk).
- `microsoft` (optional): Outlook's "Sign In with Microsoft" (`docs/extensions/mail.md` ("Outlook: Sign In with Microsoft")). `client_id` is the default client ID
  (usually unnecessary: the user enters their own Microsoft Entra-registered one in the App, encrypted in the hub and preferred over this); `redirect_uri` defaults to
  `persona-mail-oauth://outlook`, and changes must match the registration in Entra.
- `lark.token` / `lark.container` / `lark.base_url` / `lark.native_olk_token` (old syntax, **no longer effective**): since #1571, integration through the Lark gateway is provided by an extension
  (start of `docs/extensions/feishu.md`, `docs/extensions/extensions.md`). The manager still reads these keys, but doesn't connect to the Lark gateway with them; if `token` or `container` is set,
  it logs one warning at startup. Set the Agent token, container, address, and separate encrypted-message authorization (`native_olk_token`) in the Lark extension's settings instead; these keys can be removed.
- `lark.account` (optional integer, still effective): the default Lark gateway account number, `1` for the main account, `2` for the second; omitted or `0` uses the main account, valid range 1–999999999,
  e.g. `"lark": {"account": 2}`. The number comes from the `id` in the Lark gateway's `/accounts`, not the Lark user ID. Operations on Inbox Lark items from the default account omit `ol_account`,
  while other accounts pass their own number; the Inbox Agent also uses this default when handling Lark items (`docs/extensions/feishu.md` ("Multiple accounts")). The Lark extension's default account is authoritative (`default` in its messaging source's `GET accounts`, #5098):
  if the extension cannot be queried, use the last retrieved value; only if none has been retrieved since the manager started is this field used. Restart the hub after changing (`systemctl --user restart personad`).
  Server-side Inbox records are isolated and retained per account, available again when switching back.
- `lark.cli` (optional): Lark's official open-platform CLI, lark-cli, as a second Lark source besides the Lark extension (gateway) (`docs/plans/plan-lark-cli.md`):
  `"lark": {"cli": {"bin": "lark-cli", "profile": ""}}`. `bin` is a command name or absolute path, default `lark-cli`; non-absolute paths are found in a login shell
  (global npm installs often live under nvm-like directories absent from systemd's PATH); `profile` is optional lark-cli's `--profile`.
  When it is empty and the built-in Lark bot has credentials, the manager binds managed profile `persona` to the bot's app (using `config show` and `config init`, with the secret on stdin); otherwise lark-cli's default profile is used. An explicit profile always wins.
  Optional `inbox_poll_seconds` (default 120, at least 60) and `inbox_page_limit` (search pages per Inbox round, default 5; the rest continue next round) tune the lark-cli Inbox (`docs/plans/plan-lark-cli.md`, L4).
  Application and user logins stay with lark-cli (`~/.lark-cli`), never in `manager.json`: sign in from Settings › Connectors › Lark via the device link, or run
  `lark-cli auth login --domain all` yourself on the assistant's machine (or `lark-cli --profile <profile> auth login --domain all` when `lark.cli.profile` is set). The App's login starts the blocking command without `--no-wait` and polls it; after a week unused, sign in again.
  Its PATH contains `lark-cli` (with the configured `profile`), write operations go through the gate (`docs/assistant/assistant.md` ("Lark: lark-cli")), and the built-in `larkcli` connector's status, read tools, and watched-document comment Inbox are available when this section is present. Choose document links and wiki spaces in Settings › Connectors; nothing is watched by default. The app's `larkcli_profile` setting is stored with `bots.feishu` in manager settings: an empty value follows the automatic rule, while a profile name selects an existing `lark-cli profile list` entry. A non-empty `lark.cli.profile` in `manager.json` wins and makes that app choice read-only.
  The app's sign-in asks only for the connector's read-as-me scopes (the commands it uses). `lark-cli auth login --domain all` remains an optional manual step when someone wants the assistant wrapper to reach every Lark domain.
  Another personal computer where the manager starts assistant conversations (a Lark `/agent` placed there) gets lark-cli's name and the gate rules, not the profile (an absolute `bin` goes by its base name): its own lark-cli, with its default profile, tells its gate which calls only read. A work computer gets nothing.
  `extensions: true` additionally permits extensions that declare the `lark-cli` host integration to use its typed, read-only RPC for auxiliary context and auth status (`docs/extensions/extensions.md`, "Host CLI integrations"). It does not permit arbitrary commands, writes or credential export; the manager retains the binary, profile and timeouts. Omitted or false keeps this integration off.
- `lark.prefer` (optional): which source is primary when both the Lark extension (gateway) and lark-cli are available: omitted (default, extension path preferred) or `cli`; other values are the Lark extension's own source names, passed through and validated by it. Currently only affects how the assistant prompt divides the work.
- `lark_gate` (optional, old syntax, still effective; put new rules in `connector_gate` below with `connector: lark`): gate rules for the assistant's Lark writes (the Lark extension's command gate, and lark-cli), after `connector_gate`'s `lark` rules and before built-in rules; first match wins:
  `[{"method":"POST","path":"/conversations/*/messages","action":"allow"}]` (`action` is `allow` / `confirm` / `deny`, optional `body` matches top-level fields;
  `docs/assistant/assistant.md` ("Lark: skill supplied by the Lark extension")). lark-cli commands use `{"method":"CLI","path":"/im/+messages-send","action":"allow"}`
  (`path` joins command words with `/`, `*` / `**` wildcards as above); a match skips lark-cli's self-reported risk level.
- `connector_gate` (optional): gate rules for connector writes (such as `github_comment`); first match wins, no match means confirm each operation on the phone:
  `[{"connector":"github","action":"github_comment","match":{"repo":"example-org/*"},"decision":"allow"}]`
  (`connector`, `action` allow `*` wildcards; `match` matches top-level tool arguments, strings may also use wildcards; `decision` is `allow` / `confirm` / `deny`,
  an invalid list is reported in the manager's log at start; `server/internal/connector/gate.go`, `docs/plans/plan-connectors.md`). Writes matching `confirm_always` in an extension manifest clamp even an `allow` rule to `confirm` (`docs/extensions/extensions.md`). A call whose arguments give a field more than once is refused before any rule is read, and a `deny` or `confirm` rule's `match` reads field names without regard to capitals (`docs/extensions/connectors.md`, "Gate").
  The assistant's Lark write rules also go here: `connector` is `lark`, `action` is "method path", e.g. `{"connector":"lark","action":"POST /conversations/*/messages","decision":"allow"}`,
  or lark-cli's `{"connector":"lark","action":"CLI /im/+messages-send","decision":"allow"}` (`*` matches one path segment, `**` the rest, `"*"` any call; `match` matches top-level body fields).
  These precede the old `lark_gate`, followed by built-in rules (`docs/assistant/assistant.md` ("Lark: skill supplied by the Lark extension")).
- `sent_ledger_days` (optional): how many days the ledger of what was written as the user is kept (`docs/extensions/connectors.md` "Sent as the user"); omitted or 0 means 90, below 0 keeps it for good.
- `sent_recall_hours` (optional): how many hours after a send its message can still be taken back (`docs/extensions/connectors.md` "Sent as the user", Recall); omitted or 0 means 24, below 0 no limit. A connector may allow less (GitHub's comments have no limit of their own).
- `github` (optional): GitHub connector. `{"auth": {"from_machine": "<machine id>"}}`: use `gh`'s login on that machine (the hub runs `gh auth token` via the node,
  keeping the token only in hub memory, never in the database or logs, or exposing it to the App or assistant). Keep `gh` signed in there, with the login in `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml`
  (keychain credentials cannot be read via ssh: `gh auth login --insecure-storage`). `auth.host` defaults to `github.com`; put a GitHub Enterprise host name here (not implemented yet).
  Check status under **Settings › Connectors › GitHub**. `from_machine` is only a default: every hub has GitHub, and under "Sign In From" in **Settings › Connectors › GitHub**
  you can switch to another computer's gh login, or use device-code login (the built-in GitHub CLI Client ID, no OAuth App registration needed; the authorization page shows "GitHub CLI", see `docs/extensions/connectors.md` ("II · 7"));
  once chosen in the App, that wins (stored in hub settings). The connector needs `repo` scope: gh's default login has it; otherwise the page suggests `gh auth refresh -s repo`.
  `github.proxy` (optional): HTTP proxy for all requests to GitHub (device-code creation and polling at `github.com`, API at `api.github.com`, plus CI logs),
  `http://[user:password@]host:port`, same format as `google.proxy`; omitted means direct (does not read process `HTTPS_PROXY`). Some networks reach only `api.github.com`, not `github.com`,
  so device-code login cannot obtain a code and needs this proxy. An invalid value does not fall back to direct: every GitHub request fails, and the settings page states that `github.proxy` in manager.json is invalid. Actual addresses belong only in manager.json.
  The extension market also uses it to read markets on GitHub and download extension packages from Releases (`github.com`, `*.github.com`, `*.githubusercontent.com`; when unset, uses process `HTTPS_PROXY`, #3277).
  Repository binding checks of public GitHub repositories use `github.proxy` too; when unset they use the manager process's `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY`.
  GitLab and self-hosted repository checks use the process's proxy environment. Checks validate destination DNS locally and tunnel to a pinned IP, preserving TLS hostname checks;
  they do not pass connector tokens to the repository or fall back to direct when a selected proxy fails. See `docs/assistant/managers.md` ("Repository references").
  `github.inbox` (optional) supplies default Inbox rules (App changes take priority, `docs/assistant/inbox.md` ("Noise reduction")): `ci` (`off` / `default_branch` / `mine` (default) / `all`),
  `muted_repos` (`["owner/name"]`), `ignore_branches` (branches not to notify for, `path.Match` patterns, default `["train/*"]`).
- `imessage` (optional, **old syntax, retained for one version, read-only**): now choose the Mac to read in **Settings › Extensions › Messages** in the App (#1830). If configured here, the manager migrates it once at startup;
  when the extension is off or no Mac is selected, it still reads here. Messages connector. `{"machine": "<machine id>"}`: which Mac's "Messages" appear in the App (that Mac's node reads `~/Library/Messages/chat.db` read-only,
  requiring Full Disk Access; **Settings › Connectors › Messages** explains how). Configure one machine only (Macs on the same Apple ID share the same messages).
  The App can show all chats. With "Hand to Persona" on (**Settings › Connectors › Messages**, on by default, stored in the hub), real chats (members include someone in Contacts or you have spoken there)
  incrementally enter the knowledge base and Inbox by ROWID (triaged like Lark); the assistant gets `imessage_chats` / `imessage_read` / `imessage_search`; verification codes are masked. Turning it off stops everything,
  and existing data on the hub can be deleted separately. Logs contain neither numbers nor bodies (`docs/plans/plan-connectors.md` ("V")).
- `bots.feishu` (optional): application credentials for the bot used to chat with Persona in Lark: `app_id`, `app_secret`, `domain` (`feishu` / `lark` / open-platform address),
  for people who do not want to enter them in the App. Values saved in the App (**Settings › Connectors › Lark Bot**) win; switches, pairing, and all features are in the App (`docs/extensions/bots.md`).
- `extensions` (old `plugins` key still read): extensions hand-written in manager.json, started by the manager and forwarded to the App (voice chat, etc.): `id`, `name`, `kind`, `command` + `args` (or only `socket` for an extension running elsewhere),
  `dir` (working directory), `env` (extra environment variables), `disabled` (`true` disables while keeping the config), `config` (the extension's own settings), see `docs/extensions/extensions.md` ("Extensions in manager.json");
  extensions installed with `personad extension install` are registered in the database, not here. For personad's built-in voice extension (GPT-Live), use `"command": "personad", "args": ["voice"]`,
  with upstreams in `config.providers` (`docs/extensions/extensions.md` ("Built-in voice extension")). Restart the hub after changes.
- `trusted_extension_markets` (legacy): retained for configuration decoding only. Nonofficial signing metadata and saved keys no longer grant a sandbox exemption; installed extensions keep the default sandbox unless the owner explicitly chooses otherwise (`docs/extensions/extensions.md` ("Sandbox")).

## A dedicated assistant node on an existing computer

Register a separate `kind: local` machine with its manager through the atomic admin endpoint described in
`docs/assistant/managers.md` ("Registering a dedicated local computer"). Keep the existing computer's ownership and
runtime unchanged. Do not create a carrier-owned local entry and move it afterwards.

A second node opts into session discovery isolation with four absolute paths:

```sh
PERSONA_HOME=/absolute/manager-state
PERSONA_NODE_SESSION_DIR=/absolute/manager-state/assistant-m-abcdef
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/absolute/manager-state/claude
CODEX_HOME=/absolute/manager-state/codex
```

Set these on the dedicated manager service so its local stdio node and agent subprocesses inherit them. The assistant,
Claude and Codex directories must be distinct, non-overlapping descendants of the independent state root. Missing paths,
relative paths and symlink escapes are rejected. With this scope, the node discovers only the private profiles and
sessions whose actual working directory is inside the assistant directory; process, remote and terminal-host discovery
cannot add other profiles. Global hook configuration does not install or remove hooks. Built-in Persona MCP servers
explicitly carry the node's state root, including when the agent runtime filters inherited environment variables.

`manager.json` has no `assistant.dir` setting. The manager derives its assistant directory from the node's reported
`data_dir` and `identity.AssistantDirName(managerID)`. Verify that reported `cwd` and each new session's actual `cwd`
resolve to `PERSONA_NODE_SESSION_DIR`; do not rely on an ignored JSON field. An internal symlink to
`<state root>/.persona/assistant-m-abcdef` can retain assistant-directory recognition by older nodes on the same
computer. Both the link and target must stay inside the independent root. Verify the existing node does not list the
new session after the first turn, including aliases under another agent profile.

This scope isolates discovery and Persona state, not operating-system permissions. Prepare only the required provider
configuration and credentials in the private profiles; do not copy existing histories or unrelated credentials. Before
activation, verify the installed binary's version, checksum and `personad manager capabilities --json`, the four service
environment values, durable ownership and the actual derived directory. After activation, verify a reply and a harmless
Persona tool call through the dedicated node, then switch between both assistants and inspect both histories.

## DDNS (public.ddns)

Use a fixed domain to find the hub after reconnecting changes its IPv6 prefix (`docs/operations/network.md`). Omit `public.ddns` to leave it disabled.

```json
"public": {
  "tls_listen": ":18662",
  "advertise": ["https://hub.example.com:18662"],
  "ddns": {"provider": "cloudflare", "record": "hub.example.com", "zone_id": "<zone id>", "token_file": "<token file on the hub machine>"}
}
```

- `provider`:
  - `cloudflare`: updates AAAA / A records, requires `zone_id` and `token_file`; `ttl` is 1 (automatic, default) or 30–86400.
  - `webhook`: POSTs `{"record","ipv6","ipv4"}` to `webhook_url`; with `token_file`, sends it as `Authorization: Bearer`.
  - Alibaba Cloud DNS and DNSPod are not implemented yet.
- `record`: full domain name.
- `token_file`: a file containing only the token, must be a regular file with 0600 permissions. The token does not go into hub.json.
- **Which addresses are published**:
  - IPv6 follows the same rules as the candidate list: only stable local global IPv6 addresses; an already published address is kept as long as it remains stable.
  - IPv4 is published only if a public IPv4 was explicitly entered in `public.advertise`: a locally visible IPv4 does not prove public inbound reachability.
- **When it updates**: once at startup, then whenever addresses change. Failures back off exponentially from 1 second, capped at 5 minutes. Logs record only the failure reason, not the token, URL, or response content.
- **It only updates DNS**: it neither opens a listener nor allows firewall traffic. To make the App use the domain, also put the HTTPS URL including its TLS port in `public.advertise`; only then does it appear in the candidate list and the QR code's `alt`.

## For developers

- When a new feature needs a value "specific to one person" (machine name, domain, account, email, path, launcher, internal company tool), add it to one of the two configs above, never to code,
  UI text, or tests. UI text says "the hub machine" and "your computers", not specific machines.
- Details of this dev machine (available machines, hub address, where accounts live) belong in `CLAUDE.local.md` at the repo root (uncommitted), not `CLAUDE.md`.
