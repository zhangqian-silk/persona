# CLAUDE.md
## Product positioning: an Agent product for everyone

Persona is an Agent product for everyone, not a tool built only for software developers.

- **Assistant** is for everyday people: plain language, simple defaults, no engineering jargon.
- **Agents** is for people who collaborate directly with tools such as Claude Code; specialist workflows, engineering terminology, and advanced configuration belong here or in advanced settings.

Every design names its intended audience and answers "who does this serve?". Public-facing experiences stay simple; complexity lives in Agents or advanced settings.

**Fast, local-first and stateful:** show local feedback immediately and Processing as soon as the hub receives a message,
not after scheduling or model output. Keep receipt, delivery and execution distinct, make failures recoverable, and measure
feedback latency separately from execution latency (`docs/design/PRINCIPLES.md`, principle 7; super rule 5).


## Highest-priority rules

Read [the super rules](docs/SUPER_RULES.md) before acting. They take precedence over this file, `AGENTS.md`, and all
other repository documentation. Changes to the super-rules file, including additions and deletions, require a
GitHub issue and explicit approval from administrator `chyroc` in that issue before editing or opening a PR.
The PR must link the approved issue. No Agent or delegated task may bypass this requirement, even to fix a failing check.

**Product positioning: Persona is an Agent product for everyone, not only software developers.**

- **Assistant** is for everyday people, with no programming or Agent-tool knowledge required.
- **Agents** is for people who want to collaborate directly with Claude Code and other Agents.
- Before every design decision, ask **who it serves**. Keep Assistant and other everyday-facing interfaces simple and
  understandable; do not let developer terminology, engineering details or accumulating options make them harder to use.
  Put specialist workflows in Agents or advanced settings, and disclose details only when needed. For example, asking
  Assistant to organize a trip should not require choosing an Agent runtime or a repository.

Persona is a self-hosted personal SuperAgent. A Go server, `personad`, runs as the **hub** on an always-on machine and holds all state;
the clients (iPhone, Apple Watch, Mac, Vision Pro, Android and the web) talk only to the hub. Each of your computers runs a **node**
(connected to the hub through Persona Link), where coding Agents (Claude Code, Codex, pi, opencode and other runtimes) run in an engine
(herdr, Orca, Tern or Paseo); any client can watch them live, answer their questions and approve plans and tools.
The assistant's main chat (the **Persona** tab) hands work to those Agents and draws on the knowledge base (`~/.persona/data`), the Inbox,
mail, phone data tools and extensions (connectors, channels, voice). Overview: `README.md`, `docs/server/architecture.md`.

Values specific to your machines and accounts go in `CLAUDE.local.md` (not committed); without it, set up from `docs/operations/config.md`.

**Names**: the product is Persona; the binary is `personad`, the connector `persona-link`, the runtime directory `~/.persona`, the build
config `~/.config/persona/config.json`, environment variables `PERSONA_*`. Older names still work so old and new versions interoperate,
but their literals live only in each platform's compatibility files (`docs/protocol/rolling-upgrade-compatibility.md`); everything else
uses Persona. Registered app identities (bundle IDs, App Groups, keychain groups) come from private config and never change.

## Conventions (mandatory)

### Workflow

- **Every change goes issue → claim → branch → PR → merge after local verification passes** ("Development workflow" below). Code, docs and config alike;
  never commit or push to `main` directly.
- **Old issue numbers**: `#N` in lines written up to 2026-11-07 (`git blame`) refers to the previous tracker; new text cites current numbers (`docs/operations/collaboration.md`, "Rules").
- **TestFlight feedback**: issues from crash reports or testers' feedback get the `testflight` label (or a `[TestFlight]` title prefix),
  with a scrubbed body and a dedupe marker (`docs/operations/collaboration.md`, "TestFlight feedback").
- **Write lessons down as you go**: pitfalls into `docs/lessons/<topic>.md` (index `docs/lessons/README.md`), design trade-offs into the
  module doc. Only the cross-module pitfalls people hit most get a line in "Most common pitfalls" here; keep this file short.
  One-off plans, acceptance reports and audits go to `docs/archive/` when done. New maintained docs go into the Docs index below
  (`scripts/test/test_doc_paths.py` checks the index and every quoted path).
- **Quality bar**: a top App Store app. Check every changed screen (watch included) in a simulator screenshot, dark and light, through
  DEBUG launch arguments + `xcrun simctl io <udid> screenshot`, and actually look at it; compiling is not enough (`docs/operations/testing.md`).

### Public repository

This is a public open-source repository; everyone and every Agent maintains it to that standard.

- **Write as if anyone can read it**: code, docs, comments, test fixtures, file names, commit messages, issue and PR titles, bodies and
  comments. Edit history is public: changing the text later does not remove it, so don't write it in the first place.
- **No internal names**: internal company services, internal repositories, internal tools and intranet access setups never appear.
  Capabilities that need them are extensions kept in a private extension repository; this repository has only generic extension points and names.
- **Issue scope**: do not open issues here for changes to a private extension repository. If this repository also needs changes,
  describe only the work needed here in its issue, not the work in the private repository.
- **No private information**: no intranet domains / IPs / URLs, host names, real people's names or messages, personal accounts, mail
  addresses, tokens, keys or project IDs. Examples use placeholders (`<hub address>`, `me@example.com`). `scripts/privacy_check.py` checks
  (`git config core.hooksPath scripts/hooks` runs it on commit and push; `docs/operations/testing.md`, "Privacy scan").
- **Make it configurable**: machine names, domains, accounts, paths, launchers and preferences come from config (build / deploy:
  `~/.config/persona/config.json`; hub runtime: `~/.persona/hub.json`). The UI says "the hub machine" and "your computers".
- **Secrets never enter the repository**: the hub token and database password live only in `~/.persona/hub.json` (0600); mail
  credentials are AES-GCM encrypted in Postgres with the key file kept out of the database.

### Language

- **English for everything people read in the repository**: code comments, docs, commits, PR titles and bodies (a squash merge makes them
  the commit on `main`), issues and comments. Natural, concise English, not word-for-word translation. `docs/` is English only.
- **The README is bilingual**: `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` carry the same content and change in the same PR; their images come from
  `scripts/assets/make_readme_assets.py` in both languages.
- **User-facing text always goes through localization resources** (`docs/protocol/i18n.md`): Apple `apple/Shared/Localization/Localizable.xcstrings`,
  web `web/src/i18n/locales/`, Android `res/values*/strings.xml`, hub `server/internal/i18n/locales/`. Every new string ships in `en`,
  `zh-Hans` and `ja` together; the checks catch gaps. Apple: write `String(localized:)` / `Text`, run `scripts/i18n/apple_l10n.py sync <DerivedData>`
  after a build, then fill in en and ja. Apple tests run in zh-Hans.
- Chinese stays only as data that must match something real (hub or third-party output, prompts sent to a model, fixtures), marked
  `// i18n-ignore` where the checks ask.

### Server and data

- **All server state lives in the Postgres container** `persona-postgres` on the hub machine (`docs/server/server.md`); no JSON state files
  in `~/.persona/`. The exception is the knowledge base `~/.persona/data`: files first, the database as the index (`docs/assistant/knowledge.md`);
  its full-text search index (`.search/`) is a cache built from the files that can be deleted at any time (`docs/assistant/knowledge.md`, "Search index (#1273)").
- **The hub is only a communication center**: new business logic (endpoints, tables, model calls) goes into the managers
  (`server/internal/assistant`, `server/internal/devices`, `server/internal/extmgr`). `server/internal/hub/architecture_guard_test.go` pins the hub's routes,
  dependencies and Store; when it fails, move the logic as its hint says (`docs/server/architecture.md`).
- **Prompts live in `server/internal/prompts/`** (MCP tool descriptions under `mcp/`): one prompt per file, composed with templates, never
  built with `fmt` / `+` in Go. Update the golden tests and read the diff (`docs/assistant/prompts.md`).
- **Phones reach the hub directly over the internet** (TLS, preferring IPv6; VPNs are the user's own business), with the LAN kept
  compatible (`docs/operations/network.md`).

### Product and UI

- **Links open inside the app**: any link in a conversation opens in a card rising from the bottom that fills the screen; dragged down to
  0.6 it stops blocking the chat, further down it closes. Speed first (preloading, caching, reused WebViews). Selected text can go to the
  Agent as **AI edit** or **Use as context**, carried in the message as XML tags.
- **Never change how an existing screen looks directly**: a different visual style is a new **style** (`AppStyle`), a different color set a
  new **theme color** (`ThemeColor`); the default and every other option stay pixel-identical. Bug fixes and changes the user asked for
  don't count. Android works the same way with its three styles (`docs/android/android-design.md`).
- **The UI uses only the design system**: font sizes, spacing, radii, sizes, animation, colors, icons and brand marks come from tokens;
  pages never hard-code numbers, system font sizes, SF Symbol names or hex colors. Missing something? Add a token first.
- **Button text never wraps**: one line (`.lineLimit(1)`, then `.minimumScaleFactor`, shorter text or an icon); what doesn't fit in a row
  of buttons goes into a menu.
- **Desktop is the existing web app in the Electron desktop app, plus independently installable Persona Link**: on computers people use
  `desktop/` for the hub-hosted web UI, native notifications and presence. Persona Link (`persona-link`, the connector's CLI/service)
  is separately installable only on computers whose Agents the hub should reach; it owns node connectivity and the Persona Screen helper.
  The PC App does not require a local node or Link and never silently installs one. The local setup window may manage an installed Link
  through fixed CLI operations. Do not create another desktop UI or a second design system; the old native Mac app and per-OS tray UIs are
  being replaced, not extended (`docs/desktop/desktop.md`, `docs/operations/link.md`).

### Design spec for UI changes

- **Design principles**: `docs/design/PRINCIPLES.md` holds the seven product principles (defaults first, progressive disclosure,
  user control, consistency first, model and product separate, checkable rules, fast/local-first/stateful), each with how to check it. They apply to UI,
  settings and defaults, and how numbers are counted; acceptance criteria and the PR template's self-check are written against them.
- **Read the spec first**: before adding or changing any UI or interaction (any client, watch and web included), read
  `docs/design/PRINCIPLES.md` and the sections of `docs/design/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` your change touches. Follow them; they win over
  habits copied from other screens. Known gaps against Apple's guidelines are in `docs/design/HIG_AUDIT.md`; don't add new ones.
- **Structure rules** (`docs/design/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` sections 3.4, 4.8 and 5.6): in every grouping a session that needs the user is
  visible without opening anything; each pending request has one home, and every place that collects requests shows the same
  number; primary screens use the session's title and plain state words, never raw model IDs, session IDs, paths or engine names;
  a large UI change needs a person to look at its screenshots (section 1.4).
- **Say what you followed**: a PR that changes UI or interactions lists the principles and rules it followed, and for every
  deviation the reason. Run the "UI change self-check" in `docs/design/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` and put the result in the PR.
- **Spec and code change together**: a new component, token or interaction pattern updates `docs/design/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` in the same PR.

### Performance (Apple clients)

- **Read `docs/apple/performance.md` before changing `apple/` code.** Its rules P1–P12 cover main-thread IO, `@State`
  initial values, work in `body`, narrow reads, list identity, coalescing, images, background work, launch and memory,
  with budgets (no main-thread block over 100 ms, nothing over 16 ms while scrolling or typing).
- **A PR that touches `apple/` names the rules it followed** and the reason for any deviation (its review checklist).
  A performance-sensitive change (chat list, composer, Agents list, push handling, launch, images) attaches before and
  after measurements from an optimized build ("Measuring" there).
- `scripts/test/isolation-lint.sh` reads where each blocking call runs (Photos fetches, keychain and file reads, directory
  listings, image decodes) and counts it only on the main actor or where it cannot tell; no comment clears one.
  `scripts/test/test_apple_perf_patterns.py` keeps per-call localization lookups and unpaused animation timelines from
  growing per file. Neither takes a raised baseline.

## Development workflow

People and Agents follow the same steps, each with their own GitHub account. Templates and copyable `gh` commands: `docs/operations/collaboration.md`.

1. **Look for duplicates**: `gh issue list --state all --search "<keywords>"` and `gh pr list --state all --search "<keywords>"`, closed
   and merged ones included.
2. **Claim the existing issue, or create one** (`enhancement` for features, `bug` for fixes) saying what and why.
3. **Claim before you start**: comment `Claim:` / `Plan:` / `ETA:`; an Agent adds `Agent: yes (<machine id> / <branch or session>)`,
   using the config's machine id, never the host name. The author of the latest claim owns the work; nobody is assigned.
   Work that touches UI, settings or defaults, or how something is counted adds `Acceptance:`, criteria written against
   `docs/design/PRINCIPLES.md` (which principles, and what evidence shows each is met).
4. **Claimed by someone else**: if the owner updated it in the last 24 hours, leave it alone (adding information is fine). After 24 hours
   without an update, comment `Take over:` with the reason. Renew your own claim with `Progress:`.
5. **Work on your own branch / worktree** named with the issue number (`fix/123-xxx`). Bring it up to date by merging `origin/main`
   (preferred over a rebase; never force-push). Giving up: comment `Abandon:` with how far you got.
6. **Open one PR per issue**, in English, with `Fixes #N` / `Closes #N` (or `Refs #N` to link without closing) in the body. Fill in
   `.github/pull_request_template.md`, including the principles self-check when the change touches UI, settings, defaults or counts.
   `.github/workflows/pr-needs-issue.yml` closes PRs that link no issue and reopens them once the link is added.
7. **Merge after local verification passes**: run the checks in "Build and verify" for every affected area, including workflow lint for
   CI changes, and look at screenshots for UI changes. Opening or updating a PR does not run hosted CI. A scheduler dispatches full CI
   on `main`; its failures are fixed separately and do not replace the PR's local verification (`docs/operations/testing.md`, "Hosted CI").
   Then `scripts/hooks/merge-pr.sh <number>` (scans the PR with this machine's private values, which CI does not have, then squash-merges
   and deletes the branch). Make sure the issue is closed.

## Build and verify

- Portable CI: `scripts/ci/server.sh`, `scripts/ci/web.sh`, `scripts/ci/android.sh`, `scripts/ci/apple.sh`, `scripts/ci/scripts.sh`;
  runtime/SDK checks: `scripts/ci/runtimes.sh`. Same scripts locally and on hosted runners, no private config or signing secrets.
  Dependencies, optional path filters, coverage and cost: `docs/operations/testing.md` ("Hosted CI"). Manual dispatch defaults to all
  platform checks; no hosted repository guards run automatically on PRs.
- Server: `scripts/test/test-server.sh` (real Postgres on the hub machine); portable CI creates its own disposable Postgres 18 container.
  Deploy: `scripts/deploy/deploy.sh [machine id…]`.
- iOS: `scripts/app/sim.sh [-openSession <machine>/<session>]` builds, installs on your simulator and pairs it. Before xcodegen / Xcode,
  run `python3 scripts/persona_config.py xcconfig`; before a manual `xcodebuild`, `eval "$(python3 scripts/persona_config.py env)"` or an
  old Xcode reports errors that look like someone else's breakage.
- Android: `scripts/app/android.sh [install|apk|test|lint|shots]` (`docs/android/android.md`).
- Shared Rust core: `scripts/ci/core.sh` (needs rustup); a change to a wire type regenerates the clients' codecs (`native/app-core/README.md`).
- HarmonyOS: from `harmony/`, run `node --test tests/*.test.mjs` and `node tests/run-domain.mjs` (Node.js 24+), then `devecocli build --build-mode release` with the API 26 SDK and locked native SSH core. Native device checks and fixture setup: `docs/harmony/harmony.md` ("Verification").
- Web: `cd web && npm test && npm run build`, the build again after merging the latest `origin/main` (it prints the first screen's room under
  `FIRST_SCREEN_BUDGET`; changes in flight share it); deploy with `scripts/deploy/deploy.sh web` (`docs/web/web.md`).
- Docs: `python3 scripts/test/test_doc_paths.py`, `python3 scripts/test/test_doc_go_paths.py`, `python3 scripts/test/test_doc_sections.py`
  (a section name quoted after a doc path names a current heading) and `python3 scripts/test/test_doc_wire.py`
  (every WebSocket type, feature flag, extension point and manifest field has its row). Every change: `python3 scripts/privacy_check.py`.
- Releases: `docs/operations/release.md`. After `scripts/release/release.sh` uploads, run `python3 scripts/release/asc_testflight.py wait 45 <build number>`:
  it adds the build to the internal group and to the external group with Beta App Review. Report the build number and review status only after both.

## Most common pitfalls

The full list is in `docs/lessons/`; read the file for the area you touch first.

- **Several Agents share this repository**: work in your own worktree from `origin/main`, stage only your files, and check that
  `git diff origin/main...HEAD --stat` lists only them before pushing. Use your own simulator and mock hub port (check with `lsof`; stop a
  mock by its port, never `pkill -f mock_hub.py`). Look at every worktree before picking a database migration number (`docs/lessons/workflow.md`).
- Scripts that wait for background jobs or logs always have a timeout and end with a one-line verdict on success, failure and timeout.
- **Simulators only through `scripts/app/sim-boot.sh`** (`--profile default|watch|live-activity|stock`, slimmed by default); never
  `simctl create/boot` or `-destination name=…`, and never reboot someone else's. A failure only on a slim simulator gets rerun on
  `--profile stock` first; a "no system prompt appeared" test proves something only on stock. UI tests launch with `app.launchPinned()` (`docs/operations/testing.md`).
- A DEBUG launch argument's name must not equal any Swift identifier, or `release.sh`'s strings check blocks TestFlight: name switches
  `open…` / `show…` and add them to the list in `scripts/release/release.sh`.
- Release builds need `SWIFT_REFLECTION_METADATA_LEVEL = all`, or every App Intents / Shortcuts parameter is empty and the app crashes;
  Debug and the simulator never show it (`docs/lessons/ios.md`).
- A missing keychain group shared with extensions silently falls back on devices but works in the simulator: release ipas must pass
  `scripts/release/entitlements.py check` (`docs/operations/release.md`). Everything a Live Activity draws goes in its ContentState or
  App Group files; its extension can't use the keychain on a phone (`docs/apple/live-activity.md`).
- Don't write frequently changing state to UserDefaults (every write recomputes every `@AppStorage` view); use `StateCache`, and
  `@StoredValue` for heavy Mac views (`docs/lessons/macos.md`).
- App targets default to MainActor: closures the system calls on another queue are `{ @Sendable … in`, or they crash; plain data types in
  `apple/Shared` are `nonisolated`. Polling and read receipts use `.tabActiveTask` / `.onTabVisibility`, since hidden pages never get `onDisappear`.
- On the Mac, a constantly running `TimelineView(.animation)` relayouts the window every frame; hand persistent animations to Core Animation (`MacBreathingRing`).
- **Minimum compiler is Xcode 26.0 (Swift 6.2)**: wrap newer-SDK APIs in `#if compiler(>=6.4)` with the old behavior in `#else`
  (`#available` covers only runtime). Build with 26.0 when you have it; otherwise note the Xcode you used and "26.0 not verified" in the
  PR. Raising the minimum is the user's decision (`docs/lessons/ios.md`, "Minimum compatible compiler").
- The watch app targets watchOS 10 and compiles all of `Shared/`: only watchOS 10 APIs, with `#available` fallbacks (`Color.blended`, not `Color.mix`).
- Someone else's redeploy can wipe the hub's memory at any time: flows that span requests must be self-contained or persisted.
- The hub's port belongs to `personad.socket` (socket activation) and versions switch blue-green with `personad hub switch`. Before going
  back to a binary that doesn't understand `LISTEN_FDS`, run `PERSONA_HUB_SOCKET=0 scripts/deploy/hub-systemd.sh`; to stop the hub, stop the
  socket too (`docs/operations/hub-restart.md`).
- Behind a container port mapping every connection can look like the bridge gateway, and a same-machine reverse proxy makes internet
  traffic look like loopback: never trust the source address alone (`containerGateway`, `security.proxy_protocol`; `docs/operations/network.md`).
- Claude Code's config directory isn't always `~/.claude` (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`), and one session id can exist in two; take the most
  recently modified. Verify transcript or sync changes against real transcripts and bump the app's `ChatCache` version when items change
  (`docs/lessons/agents.md`, `docs/lessons/transcript.md`).
- Claude Code's transcript and hook `cwd` follow the model's Bash `cd`: place assistant and health conversations by the directory they
  started in, never their latest cwd (`docs/lessons/transcript.md`, #2368).

## Design system (iOS)

Tokens live in `apple/Shared/Design` (also compiled for the watch and widgets); values and rules in `docs/apple/ios.md` ("Design language").

| Need | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Font, emphasis, line height | `Theme.Font` levels and emphasis tokens, `.lineHeight(_:)` |
| Spacing | `Theme.Space` (4 pt grid; `page` is the side margin) |
| Corner radius | `Theme.Radius` |
| Size | `Theme.Size` + `.scaledFrame(…)` (scales with the font size); plain `frame` only for lines of 4 pt or less |
| Sidebar rows | `Theme.Sidebar` (web `--sidebar-row`): HIG row height + padding, same in every language (`docs/apple/sidebar.md`) |
| Animation | `Theme.Motion`; chat content unfolds with `.unfolding` |
| Color | `Theme` role colors, `Theme.Fill`, `Theme.Diff`, `Theme.Hue`, `Palette`, `AgentState.tone` |
| Icons, logos | `Theme.Icon` (one SF Symbol per meaning) drawn with `ThemedIcon` / `IconTile` in the style's icon language (`docs/apple/icons.md`); `Theme.Brand` drawn through `BrandMark` / `BrandTile` / `BrandBadge` |
| Style × theme color | `StyleSpec.current` (`ComponentSpec` × `ColorSpec`), one file per style in `apple/Shared/Design/Styles/` |

- **Components** live in `apple/Persona/DesignSystem`: `.surface(…)`, `.themedButton(…)`, `.themedPage()` / `.themedGroupedPage()`,
  `.themedRow()`, `Chip`, `CountBadge`, `EmptyStateView`, `Monogram`, `Loadable`, `SecretField` (never `SecureField`). Never write
  `glassEffect` / `.glass` directly or assemble a lookalike component in a page.
- **A new style** is a `ComponentSpec` + an `AppStyle` case, **a new theme color** a `ColorSpec` + a `ThemeColor` case; everything else reads
  `StyleSpec.current`, never `switch AppStyle`. BeautifulUI components appear only under that style, chosen inside design-system components.
- **Checks** in PersonaTests: `TypeScaleTests`, `IconVocabularyTests`, `TokenRatchetTests` (hard-coded values per file can only go down;
  after reducing them, delete `apple/PersonaTests/TokenBaseline.json` and rerun) and `StyleSpecTests` (contrast). Never add exemptions or raise a baseline.
- **Logic layer**: load → show → edit → save pages use an `@Observable` `XxxModel` with dependencies from `Deps` and tests with `FakeHub`;
  pull pure computation out of busy pages first (`docs/apple/ios.md`, "Logic-layer choice").
- **Android** has its own design system (`android/core/designsystem`, `docs/android/android-design.md`); `scripts/app/android_token_baseline.py`
  keeps hard-coded values going down. Check UI changes with `scripts/app/android.sh shots` in all three styles, dark and light.
