# Independent checks run in parallel; each command gets a GNU timeout (override with the CHECK_FAST_TIMEOUT_*
# variables below). Every check prints one PASS / FAIL / TIMEOUT / SKIP line with its duration, followed by a
# summary. The temp log directory is kept when a check fails or times out and removed on a fully clean run.
#
# Exit codes: 0 all checks passed, skipped or not needed; 1 one or more checks FAILED; 124 no failure but at least
# one check TIMEOUT (a timeout is reported, not silently treated as success; run the full suite when that happens).
# Ctrl-C, SIGTERM and SIGHUP, to the script or to its whole process group, stop every running check first, keep the
# log directory, and exit 130, 143 or 129.
# A missing optional toolchain (node < 22, go, bun) skips only its checks in diff mode; in --all mode a missing
# core tool (node >= 22, go, python3) is a failure.
#
# This script never runs iOS/macOS checks (use a Mac with scripts/app/sim.sh; PersonaKit: swift test, docs/operations/testing.md),
