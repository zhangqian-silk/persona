# The downloads (dl/*.gz) live in the R2 bucket DL_BUCKET, not in the site: a Workers static file is at most 25 MiB
# (#2541). A release goes to one of two slots, <slot>/<name>, the one not served now; the deploy then switches dl/SLOT
# (a static file, deployed with latest.json) to it. The slot left keeps the release before until the next one, so a
# download that started before the deploy finishes. Only the newest version is served there. Every release also goes
# to release/<version>/ (its node builds and its manifest as manifest.json), kept: a hub's manager fetches the node build
# of the hub's own version from there (dl/<version>/…, docs/operations/node-update.md), a Docker image's version too (X.Y.Z, when
# the release is the tag vX.Y.Z). release.sh runs this after uploading to TestFlight.
